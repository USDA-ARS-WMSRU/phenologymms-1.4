 aGE("Tasseling","The stage when the tassels emerge from the whorl on the corn plant and are fully visible and ready to produce pollen. This is the last stage in the vegetative portion of the life cycle of the plant and is called the VT stage. Technically, this stage occurs when the last tassel branch has emerged from the whorl. However, this can vary with different hybrids.");

It is abbreviated as 'TT' as seen in the Phenology and Developmental Sequence Diagrams.");
 aGE("TI","Abbreviation of the Tiller Initiation growth stage.");
 aGE("Tiller","Additional lateral shoots formed from axillary buds. They emerge from the axils of the true leaves at the base of the main stem. They can contribute to the final yield of the plant however, not all tillers produce grain.");
