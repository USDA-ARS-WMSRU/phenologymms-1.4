 aGE("Vine","A growth habit in Dry Beans. The plant gows as a vine and is indeterminate. That is, it continues to flower throughout the season because the terminal bud and lateral branches end in vegetative structures and therefore continue to produce more nodes and flower longer than the Bush type.");
 aGE("VN","Abbreviation for the growth stage in Dry Beans when the nth trifoliate leaf has unfolded at the nth node. It is the last vegetative stage. See Reference: Schwartz, H. F., et al., 2004. Dry Bean Production and Pest Management Bulletin 562A, Colorado State Univ.");
 aGE("VT","Abbreviation for the final vegetative stage in corn which occurs when the entire tassel is visible on the corn plant.");
 aGE("Water Limiting","Conditions where water is a limiting factor to plant growth. This might be analogous to dryland or rainfed conditions.");
 aGE("Water Non-Limiting","Conditions where water is not a limiting factor to plant growth. This might be analogous to irrigated conditions.");
 aGE("Water-Filled Pore Space","The spaces between the solid particles in the soil which are filled with water.");
 aGE("Watery Ripe","The first stage in kernel development. The kernel has a clear liquid at this stage and little dry matter has accumulated.");
 aGE("Weather File","Many files are included with PhenologyMMS that contain weather data for specific locations. The number of years included in the files varies among locations. At the least, maximum and minimum daily temperatures and daily precipitation are required in a weather file but, other measurements may also be included.");
 aGE("wfpslo","An input parameter to the emergence subroutine. Each soil moisture condition has a range of values for the percent of pore spaces that are filled with water. This parameter gives the low end of that range.");
 aGE("wfpsup","An input parameter to the emergence subroutine. Each soil moisture condition has a range of values for the percent of pore spaces that are filled with water. This parameter gives the upper or high end of that range.");
 aGE("Whorl","A circle of leaves or flower parts.");
 aGE("Yield","The part of the plant/crop which is harvested and provides an economic return, e.g., grain, fruits, forage, etc.");
 aGE("Zadoks Scale","A standardized reference scale used to evaluate and measure the growth stage of a cereal plant.");
 aGE("Zea mays L.","The scientific name for Corn.");
