Corn maturity classes are based on the Days to Maturity and given as 90, 95, up to 120 days. However, this has more to do with the amount of time a hybrid takes to lose grain moisture in the field compared to a standard hybrid and less to do with actual calendar days to maturity.   Dry Beans maturity classes are an estimate of how many days it will take to go from planting to vine cutting.   Winter Wheat maturity classes are an estimate of time to Heading.   Spring Barley is considered to be physiologically mature when the grain moisture content is between 30 -40 %. No more dry matter will be accumulated at this point.  Foxtail and Proso millet maturity classes are given in terms of days to maturity.  Sorghum time to maturity or maturity classes are based on the accumulation of GDD's.
