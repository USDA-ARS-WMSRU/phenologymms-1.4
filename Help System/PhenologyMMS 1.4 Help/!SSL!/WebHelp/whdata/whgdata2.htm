 aGE("Latitude","\"In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east-west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.\" Wikipedia");
 aGE("Leaf Area","The area of green leaf per unit of a given area of ground.");
 aGE("Leaf Axil","The junction where the leaf joins the main stem.");
 aGE("Leaf Number","The amount of leaves produced by a given growth stage or the number of accumulated GDD's. Leaves are generally not added once the plant reaches the first reproductive stage.");
 aGE("Leaf Number Table","In the Output screen, a table is provided which shows the number of leaves predicted to have been produced by the Day of Year. There are entries for each successive new leaf and the Day of Year on which it occurred.");
 aGE("Leaved","A variety type in spring wheat and spring barley usually preceeded by a number. For example, '8-Leaved' which means this variety would be expected to have a maximum of 8 leaves produced.This is a maturity classification for these crops.");
 aGE("Leaves","Part of the vegetative portion of the plant which provides photosynthate to the growing parts of the plant.");
 aGE("Lemma","The lower, outer bract that encloses the flower in the spikelet.");

 aGE("LN","Refers to the number of leaves that can be expected to have formed by a particular growth stage for the selected crop under Non-stressed growing conditions. This is found in the crop's Growth Stages screen. Even though leaf numbers are shown in the Growth Stages screens for the reproductive stages when additional leaves would not be added, it is given as a method of determining the growth stage based on the number of GDD's accumulated from the last growth stage divided by the crop's phyllochron value.");

 aGE("Lower Optimum Temperature","The low end of the optimum temperature range of values for plant growth. It is abbreviated as Toptlo.");

 aGE("LVS","In the VarTypes file (provided with the program) for each crop, LVS refers to one method of simulating the growth stages. This method uses the Number of Leaves values under NO stress conditions. This abbreviation is also found in the Phenology and Developemental Sequence Diagrams in the number of leaves row (#LVS).");

 aGE("Male Flower","The male flower or stamen is composed of the anthers and filament.");
 aGE("Maturity","The plant has completed development and no additional dry matter is added to the plant. Grain ripening follows maturity. This is abbreviated 'M' in the Growth Stages screen and PM in the Phenology and Developmental Sequence diagrams. This is analogous to Physiological Maturity which is abbreviated as 'PM'.");
 aGE("Maturity Class","Different crops determine maturity classes differently. Corn maturity classes are based on the Days to Maturity and given as 90, 95, up to 120 days. However, this has more to do with the amount of time a hybrid takes to lose grain moisture in the field compared to a standard hybrid and less to do with actual calendar days to maturity.   Dry Beans maturity classes are an estimate of how many days it will take to go from planting to vine cutting.   Winter Wheat maturity classes are an estimate of time to Heading.   Spring Barley is considered to be physiologically mature when the grain moisture content is between 30 -40 %. No more dry matter will be accumulated at this point.  Foxtail and Proso millet maturity classes are given in terms of days to maturity.  Sorghum time to maturity or maturity classes are based on the accumulation of GDD's.   The Sunflower is determined to be mature when a major portion of the back of the sunflower head is turning brown.");
 aGE("Maturity Group","In soybean, the maturity classification of a variety depends on its adaptability to effectively utilize the growing season, i.e., the photoperiod and temperature in a given region. The different regions are east to west belts and are rather narrow from north to south. The Maturity Group classifications range from 00 in the northern regions to VIII in the southern regions of the United States. There are ten divisions within each maturity group, as well, e.g., 3.0 to 3.9.");

 aGE("Medium","An input needed by the emergence subroutine. This is a descriptive estimation of the soil moisture condition at planting and is the next best seedbed moisture condition. Soil moisture conditions are good but not as good as Optimum.");
