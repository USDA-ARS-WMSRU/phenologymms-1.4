The columns Day of Year, Date, DAP, DAE and DAV provide this information. The predicted number of Growing Degree-Days for each stage after a specific event, e.g., 'Planting',  'Emergence' or 'Vernalization' are provided in the columns GDD AP, GDD AE, and GDD AV. The Number of Leaves predicted for each vegetative stage is also displayed in the table. The number of leaves shown in the reproductive stages is the same as that at the last vegetative stage and shows that no new leaves are added in the reproductive stages.");

It is usually characterized by the seed having attained the maximum dry weight with no more growth occurring.
