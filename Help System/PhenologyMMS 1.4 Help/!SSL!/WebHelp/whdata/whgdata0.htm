Bush type plants have a thicker main stem, fewer internodes and flower for a shorter time. These are known as the Type I classification.");
 aGE("Canopy Height","The canopy of a crop is the collection of the aboveground portion of the plants  formed by the individual plant crowns  in the field or community. Canopy height refers to the height of this aboveground biomass.");

 aGE("Collar","This occurs in grasses at the outer side of the leaf where the leaf blade and sheath come together.");
 aGE("Collared Leaf","This is used to determine if a plant has fully reached a vegetative stage marked by a particular number of leaves. If, for example, three leaves have emerged and the collar is visible with each leaf, the plant could be said to be in the 'three-leaf stage'.");

 aGE("Disk Flowers","Flowers that occur in the central part of the head as seen in Sunflower. These flowers are tubular in shape and it is from these flowers that the seeds are produced.");
 aGE("Double Ridge","“In grasses, this stage follows the single ridge stage. At this stage, the tissue immediately above the single ridge develops into the spikelet primordium causing the “double ridges”. The leaf primordium (i.e., the ridge below the spikelet primordium) does not further differentiate and these ridges become less visible as successive double ridges until they are no longer noticeable. The spikelet primordia continue to differentiate and produce spikelets until the Terminal Spikelet stage (i.e., the last spikelet formed at the top of the developing spike). The double ridge stage is abbreviated as 'DR'.”");
