<h1>Sunflower Growth Stages</h1>
<p>The Sunflower (<span style="font-style: italic;">Helianthus annuus</span> 
 L.) <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Growth Stages<?rh-glo_end ?> screen 
 displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see 
 the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth 
 stages screen.</p>

<p>PhenologyMMS presents fourteen growth stages for sunflower. The following 
 publication was very helpful in the description of each stage: <a href="../../../PhenologyMMS-1.3/Help System/PhenologyMMS 1.3 Help/References_and_Documents/References_and_Documents.htm#Sunflower_growth_stages"><span

<p><?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Seeding<?rh-glo_end ?> to <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Emergence<?rh-glo_end ?> (E) - at emergence, the <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>hypocotyl<?rh-glo_end ?> arch and the cotyledons have 
 pushed through the soil. The first true leaf blade is present but not 
 yet long enough to be counted as a leaf. A leaf blade is considered to 
 be a true leaf when it has attained a length of 4 cm.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>E to 4th Leaf (V4) - four <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>V4 to 8th Leaf (V8) - eight leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater 
 in length.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>V8 to 12th Leaf (V12) - twelve leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater 
 in length.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>V12 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Flower Visible<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R1) - the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>inflorescence<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 becomes visible. It is surrounded by immature bracts which when viewed 
 from above have a star-like appearance. The appearance of R1 can vary 
 among genotypes with respect to the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>number 
 of leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> already produced.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R1 to Internode Elongation Starts &#160;(R2) - the internode below the 
 base of the inflorescence and above the nearest leaf that is attached 
 to the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>stem<?rh-glo_end ?>, begins to 
 elongate but is less than 2 cm.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R2 to Internode Elongation &gt; 2 cm (R3) - the internode below the 
 base of the developing <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>head<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 continues to elongate and is now greater than 2 cm. It pushes the inflorescence 
 above the surrounding leaves.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R3 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Flower Opens<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R4) - the inflorescence begins to open making small ray flowers visible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Anthesis Starts<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R5) - the ray flowers are mature and fully extended. All the <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>disk flowers<?rh-glo_end ?> are visible. This stage 
 can be divided into substages depending on how many of the disk flowers 
 are in or have completed <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>anthesis<?rh-glo_end ?>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R5 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Anthesis Ends<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R6) - at this stage, anthesis is finished and the ray flowers are wilting. 
 The ray flowers vary as to whether they wilt and abscise immediately or 
 not.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R6 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Flower Yellow<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R7) - the back of the head begins to turn a light yellow beginning at 
 the center of the head or it may start at the edge of the head adjacent 
 to the bracts.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R7 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Flower Brown<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R8) - the back of the head is yellow but may contain some brown spots. 
 The bracts are still green.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R8 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> (R9) 
 - the bracts are turning yellow and brown. Much of the back of the head 
 may become brown. This is <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>physiological 
 maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>seed<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 moisture is about 35%.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>R9 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Harvest Ready<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 - the plant is ready for harvest when the seeds are at 14 - 15 % moisture. 
 They need to be dried down to 10% after harvest.</p>

<p>The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Sunflower 
 varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity and type. There 
 are four varieties relating to maturity and include <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Early 
 Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?>, <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Medium Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Generic<?rh-glo_end ?> which are 
 equivalent, and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Late Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 Two additional varieties are listed for <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Oil<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Seed sunflowers<?rh-glo_end ?>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Run<?rh-glo_end ?>... button executes 
 the program with the selections that have been chosen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, 
 default values.</p>
