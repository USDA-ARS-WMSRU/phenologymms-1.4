<h1>Growth Stages Example</h1>
<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Growth Stages<?rh-glo_end ?> screen 
 in PhenologyMMS is designed specifically for each crop. It contains the 
 appropriate growth stages for the crop and provides two ways to determine 
 which growth stage the plant is in. The image below displays the Generic 
 variety of Winter Wheat.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img src="Winter Wheat Growth Stages.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" 
		 width="736" height="493" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The left hand side of the screen contains parameters for each stage 
 using Growing Degree Days (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>GDD<?rh-glo_end ?>), 
 i.e., <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>thermal time<?rh-glo_end ?>, in 
 a non-stressed environment comparable to an irrigated field and a stressed 
 environment analogous to a dryland or rainfed operation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The two columns on the right hand side of the screen show the number 
 of <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> added at each 
 growth stage based on the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>phyllochron<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 entered for the crop on the Temperatures screen in the &quot;Growing Degree-Days 
 per Leaf&quot; edit box, again under non-stressed and stressed conditions. 
 These values are editable. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the user has a better estimate of the number of GDD for a stage or 
 stages or for the number of leaves in any of the four columns, they may 
 enter that value for the appropriate stage. &#160;Rarely, is a crop completely 
 stressed or completely non-stressed so an intermediate value may be a 
 better choice in either the stressed or the non-stressed column - whichever 
 one the user feels the crop is closest to under current conditions. A 
 combination of selections can be used. For example, a user might select 
 some number of growth stage values in the non-stressed column while the 
 plant/crop is not stressed and then select growth stage values in the 
 stressed column when the plant/crop is likely to encounter stressful growing 
 conditions. The same applies to the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Number 
 of Leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> columns if the user is using this method to determine 
 when a growth stage is reached. It is possible to use any combination 
 of all four columns. Note: if the GDD value for a stage is changed, the 
 number of leaves for that stage does not update.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The other selection the user will want to make is the Variety. Different 
 crops have differing numbers of varieties available in the Variety drop-down 
 box. Sometimes there are only four which include Early Maturing, Medium 
 Maturing, Late Maturing and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Generic<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 The Generic variety is the same as the Medium Maturing variety.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Variety drop down box lists one or more varieties for the crop displayed. 
 At the least, there are always four varieties: Generic, <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Early Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?>, <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Medium 
 Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Late Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 The Medium Maturity variety is equal to the Generic variety. Corn is the 
 exception to this standard. Corn is presented in terms of 'Days', e.g., 
 '110 Day', which indicates the approximate days to maturity. For some 
 crops, additional named varieties or plant type varieties are given. Dry 
 Beans adds two varieties based on growth type, i.e., <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Bush<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Vine<?rh-glo_end ?>. Spring Barley 
 and Spring Wheat add additional varieties based on the total number of 
 leaves expected, e.g., '8-leaved;. Sunflower adds two varieties for the 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Oil<?rh-glo_end ?> and <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Seed<?rh-glo_end ?> (confectionery) types of sunflower.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Run<?rh-glo_end ?>... button executes 
 the program with the selections that have been chosen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, 
 default values.</p>
