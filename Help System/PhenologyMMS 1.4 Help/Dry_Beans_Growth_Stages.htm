<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Growth Stages<?rh-glo_end ?> screen 
 for Dry Beans (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Phaseolus vulgaris <span 
	 style="font-style: normal;">L.</span><?rh-glo_end ?>) is displayed 
 below showing the parameters for the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Generic<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 variety. Please see the <a href="Growth_Stages_Example.htm#Growth_Stages_Example">Growth 
 Stages Example</a> topic for a general description of the growth stages 
 screen.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>There are fourteen growth stages for dry beans. According to the &quot;<a 
	 href="References_and_Documents.htm#Dry_bean_production_and_pest_management">Dry 
 Bean Production &amp; Pest Management Bulletin 562A</a>&quot;, there are 
 four developmental stages in Dry Beans. Stage I is the first part of the 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>vegetative phase<?rh-glo_end ?> and 
 includes <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>germination<?rh-glo_end ?>, 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>emergence<?rh-glo_end ?> and the early 
 part of vegetative growth. Stage II occurs in the latter half of the vegetative 
 phase from the emergence of the third <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>trifoliate 
 leaf<?rh-glo_end ?> to the first flower opening. Stage III is in the first 
 part of the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>reproductive phase<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 of the life cycle. While in Stage III, the plant progresses from the first 
 flower to mid <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>pod<?rh-glo_end ?> set. 
 The last stage, Stage IV, completes the reproductive phase of plant growth 
 and occurs from the beginning of filling of the first-formed pods to <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> and ready for harvest.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Vegetative:</p>
<p><?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Seeding<?rh-glo_end ?> to Emergence 
 E) - the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>seedling<?rh-glo_end ?> emerges 
 through the soil and the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>hypocotyl<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 appears.</p>
<p>E to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Cotyledonary Leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>VC<?rh-glo_end ?>) - there are two 
 cotyledons above ground at the first <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>node<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 and two primary, unifoliate <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 are unfolded at node 2.</p>
<p>VC to 1st Trifoliate Leaf (V1) - the first trifoliate leaf has unfolded 
 at node 3.</p>
<p>V1 to 2nd Trifoliate Leaf (V2) - the second trifoliate leaf has unfolded 
 at node 4.</p>
<p>V2 to 3rd Trifoliate Leaf (V3) - the third trifoliate leaf has unfolded 
 at node 5.</p>
<p>V3 to 4th Trifoliate Leaf (V4) - the fourth trifoliate leaf has unfolded 
 at node 6. Branches develop and vegetative growth progresses rapidly.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Reproductive:</p>
<p>V4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Bloom<?rh-glo_end ?> (R1) - 
 there is one open flower.</p>
<p>R1 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Mid-Full Flower<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R2) - 50% of the flowers are open.</p>
<p>R2 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Early Pod Set<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R3/<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>VN<?rh-glo_end ?>) - one pod has 
 reached maximum length. The Early <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Pod 
 Set<?rh-glo_end ?> R3 stage is also the VN stage when the last trifoliate 
 leaf is produced. Leaves continue to be added until &#160;the R3/VN stage.</p>
<p>R3 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Mid Pod Set<?rh-glo_end ?> (R4) 
 - 50% of the pods are at maximum length.</p>
<p>R4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Early Seed Fill<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R5) - one pod has fully developed seeds.</p>
<p>R5 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Mid Seed Fill<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R6) - 50% of the pods contain fully developed seeds.</p>
<p>R6 to Maturity (R7) - one pod has changed color to a mature color such 
 as yellow, tan, purple or even striped. This indicates <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>physiological maturity<?rh-glo_end ?>.</p>
<p>R7 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Harvest Ready<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R8) - the plant is ready to be harvested; 80% of the pods have changed 
 to the mature color.</p>

<p>The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Dry 
 Bean types and varieties. Two types of dry beans based on growth habit 
 are included and they are <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Bush<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 or <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Vine<?rh-glo_end ?> types. There 
 are three selections based on time to Maturity and include <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Early Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> (E, 85-95 days), <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Medium Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> (also Generic in this 
 listing) (M, 90-94 days), <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Full Season<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (F, 95-99 days) (not currently included in the variety drop down list) 
 and <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Late Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> (L, 
 100 or more days). Quite a few varieties are listed with these Maturity 
 designations and an additional one relating to growth habit. The&#160;growth 
 habits include: V (vine), SU (semi-upright), U (upright) and B (Bush).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Run<?rh-glo_end ?>... button executes 
 the program with the selections that have been chosen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, 
 default values.</p>
