<p class="msonormal">Four temperature <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>inputs<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 are displayed that are used in calculating the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>growing 
 degree-days<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>GDD<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 for each day as described in each <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>GDD 
 method<?rh-glo_end ?> below:</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Base temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tbase<?rh-glo_end ?>) is the temperature 
 below which no GDD are accumulated. The assumption is that phenological 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>development<?rh-glo_end ?> does not 
 occur below the base temperature, and therefore no GDD's are accumulated 
 on that day. Tbase is used in all methods of calculating GDD (discussed 
 below).</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Lower Optimum 
 temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Toptlo<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 is the lower end of the optimum temperature range for <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>growth<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 This is used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any 
 of the crops in <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>PhenologyMMS 1.3<?rh-glo_end ?>.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Upper Optimum 
 temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Toptup<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 is the upper end of the optimum temperature range for growth. This is 
 used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any of the 
 crops in PhenologyMMS 1.3.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The Upper/Maximum temperature (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tupper<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 is the highest temperature at which growth can still occur. This is used 
 in Methods 2, 3 and 4 but only Method 2 is implemented for any of the 
 current crops in PhenologyMMS 1.3.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">There are many ways that the GDD required between 
 phenological stages can be calculated. Four commonly used methods are 
 available in PhenologyMMS however, only two methods are currently implemented.&#160;&#160;Although 
 these four methods are fairly similar, they have slight variations in 
 approach and the temperature variables used.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><b>WARNING: If you change the temperature values or 
 the GDD Method in the Temperature screen, this will have an adverse effect 
 on the simulation output as the parameter values in the Set Growth Stages 
 screen which are based on the particular Method of calculating GDD for 
 the crop, are NOT adjusted when temperatures or the GDD Method are changed.</b></p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The four GDD METHODS used are described below. For

										 font-size: 12pt;">.</span> &#160;A 
 diagram of the four GDD Methods is displayed <a href="GDD_Methods.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><b>GDD METHOD 1</b></p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">This is probably the simplest method of the four. 
 The Average (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tavg<?rh-glo_end ?>) of 
 the Maximum temperature (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tmax<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 and the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Minimum temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tmin<?rh-glo_end ?>) is calculated. 
 The Tbase is then subtracted from the Tavg. If the result is negative 
 then the value is set equal to zero.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">Method 1 is generally used for grasses and here it 
 is applied to Winter Wheat, Spring Wheat, Winter Barley, Spring Barley, 
 Proso Millet and Hay Millet.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><b>GDD METHOD 2</b></p>
<p class="msonormal">This is another way of calculating GDD and uses the 
 Upper Temperature (Tupper) threshold for the crop. GDD above the Tupper 
 are not accumulated. Tbase is also used in this Method. Both Tmax and 
 Tmin are compared to Tbase and if Tmax and/or Tmin is less than Tbase 
 then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to the value of Tbase. Likewise, if 
 Tmax and/or Tmin is greater than Tupper, then Tmax and/or Tmin is set 
 equal to Tupper. The average temperature is calculated and Tbase is subtracted 
 from Tavg. If the resulting value is less than zero, then it is set to 
 zero.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">Method Two is used for Corn, Dry Beans, Sorghum, Soybeans 
 and Sunflower.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><b>GDD METHOD 3</b></p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">This method employs a two-segmented linear model. 
 The first segment extends from Tbase to an Optimum Temperature (<?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Topt<?rh-glo_end ?>), and the second segment extends 
 from Topt to Tupper. The Average temperature is calculated and compared 
 to Tbase and Topt. If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and less 
 than or equal to Topt, then a temperature factor '<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>tf<?rh-glo_end ?>', 
 which uses the slope of the first segment of the line, is calculated and 
 multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase. This gives the GDD value 
 for the day. However, if the Tavg is greater than Topt and less than or 
 equal to Tupper, then 'tf', which uses the slope of the second segment 
 of the line, is multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase to give today’s 
 GDD value. If neither comparisons are true and Tavg is less than Tbase 
 or greater than Tupper, then the GDD for the day is zero.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><b>GDD METHOD 4</b></p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">This Method uses a three-segmented linear model. The 
 first segment extends from Tbase to the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo); 
 the second segment from Toptlo to the Upper Optimum Temperature (Toptup); 
 the third segment runs from Toptup to Tupper.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">The Average temperature (Tavg) is calculated and compared 
 to Tbase and the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo). If Tavg is greater 
 than or equal to Tbase and if Tavg is less than Toptlo, then Tbase is 
 subtracted from Tavg. This value is multiplied by the calculated temperature 
 factor 'tf' which is calculated using the slope of this first segment 
 of the line to get the GDD value for the day. However, if Tavg is greater 
 than or equal to Toptlo and less than or equal to Toptup, then Tbase is 
 subtracted from Tavg and that value is multiplied by 'tf' which has been 
 calculated using the slope of the second line segment. This gives the 
 GDD value for the day. If Tavg is greater than Toptup and less than or 
 equal to Tupper, then 'tf' is calculated using the slope of this third 
 segment of the line and is multiplied by the result of Tavg minus Tbase 
 to yield the GDD value for the day. If none of the situations are true 
 and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then GDD for the day 
 is set equal to zero.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">You can choose the GDD method with which to <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>run<?rh-glo_end ?> the model however, only Methods 
 1 and 2 are currently implemented. The default is Method 1. Click on the 
 down arrow to pick one of the other methods.</p>

 class="glossterm"?>phyllochron<?rh-glo_end ?>, or GDD per leaf, is also 
 entered in this screen in the 'Growing Degree-Days per Leaf:' edit box. 
 This refers to the number of GDD’s required to produce an additional leaf.</p>
