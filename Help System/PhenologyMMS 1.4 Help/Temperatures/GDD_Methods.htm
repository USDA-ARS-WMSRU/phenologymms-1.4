<h1>GDD Methods</h1>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; 
	 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There are many methods used to calculate 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>growing degree-days<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>GDD<?rh-glo_end ?>). PhenologyMMS provides four methods, 
 although default parameters for each crop are available for only one specific 
 method. For example, parameters for Method 1 are provided for winter wheat 
 &#160;while parameters for Method 2 for are provided for corn. A description 
 of each of the Methods follows.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a name="GDD Method 1" 
	 id="GDD Method 1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
	 background-color: Transparent; text-decoration: none; ">GDD&#160;Method 
 1</a> - this is a very common and simple method of calculating GDD. GDD 
 is calculated by summing the daily <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>maximum 
 temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tmax<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 and the daily <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>minimum temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tmin<?rh-glo_end ?>), dividing that 
 result by two to estimate the daily average temperature (<?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>Tavg<?rh-glo_end ?>), and then subtracting the <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>base temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tbase<?rh-glo_end ?>) 
 from Tavg. Tbase is the temperature below which the process of interest 
 does not progress.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tavg 
 = ((Tmax + Tmin)/2)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;GDD 
 = (Tavg - Tbase)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Note: 
 GDD &gt;= 0 (i.e., cannot be negative). If the GDD value is less than 
 zero, it is set equal to 0.0.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Method 1 is 
 commonly used for small grains such as wheat, barley and millet.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a name="GDD Method 2" 
	 id="GDD Method 2" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">GDD 
 Method 2</a> - this method is a slight variation of <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>GDD 
 Method<?rh-glo_end ?> 1. The differences are:&#160;a) adding an upper 
 temperature threshold (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tupper<?rh-glo_end ?>), 
 which limits the amount of GDD that can be accumulated for the day, and 
 b) adjusting Tmax and Tmin for each day based on the base (Tbase) and 
 upper (Tupper) thresholds as follows. Both Tmax and Tmin are compared 
 to Tbase and if Tmax and/or Tmin is less than Tbase then Tmax and/or Tmin 
 is set equal to Tbase. Likewise, if Tmax and/or Tmin is greater than Tupper, 
 then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to Tupper. The average temperature 
 is calculated and Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. If the resulting value 
 is less than zero, then it is set to zero.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">Method Two is used for Corn, Dry Beans, Sorghum, Soybean, 
 and Sunflower.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a name="GDD Method 3" 
	 id="GDD Method 3" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">GDD&#160;Method 
 3</a> - this method employs a two-segmented linear model. The first segment 
 extends from Tbase to an Optimum Temperature (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Topt<?rh-glo_end ?>), 
 and the second segment extends from Topt to Tupper. The Average temperature 
 is calculated and compared to Tbase and Topt. If Tavg is greater than 
 or equal to Tbase and less than or equal to Topt, then a temperature factor 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>tf<?rh-glo_end ?>), which uses the 
 slope of the first segment of the line, is calculated and multiplied by 
 the value of Tavg minus Tbase. This gives the GDD value for the day. However, 
 if the Tavg is greater than Topt and less than or equal to Tupper, then 
 'tf', which uses the slope of the second segment of the line, is multiplied 
 by the value of Tavg minus Tbase to give today's GDD value. If neither 
 comparisons are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, 
 then the GDD for the day is zero.&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a name="GDD Method 4" 
	 id="GDD Method 4" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">GDD&#160;Method 
 4</a> - this method uses a three-segmented linear model. The first segment 
 extends from Tbase to the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Lower Optimum 
 Temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Toptlo<?rh-glo_end ?>); 
 the second segment from Toptlo to the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Upper 
 Optimum Temperature<?rh-glo_end ?> (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Toptup<?rh-glo_end ?>); 
 the third segment runs from Toptup to Tupper. The Average temperature 
 (Tavg) is calculated and compared to Tbase and the Lower Optimum Temperature 
 (Toptlo). If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and if Tavg is less 
 than Toptlo, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. This value is multiplied 
 by the calculated temperature factor, 'tf' which is calculated using the 
 slope of this first segment of the line to get the GDD value for the day. 
 However, if Tavg is greater than or equal to Toptlo and less than or equal 
 to Toptup, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg and that value is multiplied 
 by 'tf' which has been calculated using the slope of the second line segment 
 (which is 1). This gives the GDD value for the day. If Tavg is greater 
 than Toptup and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf' is calculated 
 using the slope of the third segment of the line and is multiplied by 
 the result of Tavg minus Tbase to yield the GDD value for the day. If 
 none of the situations are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater 
 than Tupper, then GDD for the day is set equal to zero.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">All methods 
 calculate <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>thermal time<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 as described above, however Methods 3 and 4 add another modifier to the 
 thermal time calculation which assumes that not all temperatures between 
 Tbase and the maximum temperature have the same effect on plant development. 
 For example, temperatures at the optimum level (Method 3), or in the optimum 
 range (Method 4) result in faster development than those near Tbase or 
 the maximum temperature. Therefore, the calculated thermal time is then 
 reduced by the 0-1 development rate factor (shown on the y-axis) to calculate 
 the final thermal time for the day. Adding this development rate factor 
 is often considered theoretically more correct, but often in practice 
 for field conditions does not result in significant improvement in accuracy 
 for many reasons. Further, it adds additional parameters for optimum temperature 
 (or range) and uses a simple linear relationship. <span style="font-size: 12pt; 
														 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The 
 figures for Methods 3 and 4 also show a curvilinear relationship for calculating 
 thermal time and the development rate factor, but this approach has not 
 been incorporated into PhenologyMMS.</span></p>
