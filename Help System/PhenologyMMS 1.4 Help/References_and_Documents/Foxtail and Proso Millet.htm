Millet is a general term for a wide range of small seeded cereals (Marcon 1994). 
 The millets of the Poaceae (Gramineae) are small seeded annual grasses,
 including a wide range of cereals, that may be used both as grain and for
 forage (Schery 1972).  Millets can be successfully grown in a wide range of
 environmental conditions, being better adapted than most crops to hot, dry
 regions.  They are of potential value particularly in semiarid regions because
 of their short growing seasons.  They can either tolerate drought and intense
 heat or avoid these conditions by growing to maturity very quickly.  The
 millets can play an important role in the economy of many less-developed
 countries of the Old World because they are consumed directly for human food.
 However, the millets in the western world are grown primarily for birdseed,
 livestock feed, hay, or as an emergency catch crop (Casey and Lorenz 1977).  
<H2><A name="CLASSIFICATION AND DOMESTICATION">CLASSIFICATION AND DOMESTICATION 
</A></H2>Millets are thought to have been among the first cultivated crops, 
being one of the stable foods in central and eastern Asia (mainly in China, 
India, and Russia), Europe and some parts of Africa during the very early ages 
(Wietgrefe 1990).  Millets are diverse enough in type that they occur in two 
tribes of the grass family (Rachie 1975) as shown in <A href="https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/V3-182.html#Table 1">Table 
1</A>. 
<P><I>Eleusine coracana</I>, known as finger or African millet, is the only
 species of economic importance in the tribe Chlorideae.  Finger millet has been
 grown predominantly in India and Africa, both for grain and forage.  In
 contrast to most millet, it requires mild weather and a considerable amount of
 rainfall to mature (Haq 1989).  The tribe Paniceae is the largest tribe of the
 Poaceae, containing 71 genera with approximately 1400 species distributed
 mainly in tropical and also temperate regions (Roshevits 1980).  Economically
 important cultivated millets in the tribe Paniceae are: pearl millet
 (<I>Pennisetum americanum</I> L.) (Andrews et al. 1993) foxtail millet
 (<I>Setaria italica</I> L. Beauv.), proso millet (<I>Panicum miliaceum</I> L.),
 and Japanese millet (<I>Echinochloa frumentaceae</I> L.).  
<P>The genus <I>Panicum</I> is one of the largest genera of the grasses, 
including more than 400 species distributed primarily in the tropics and 
subtropics and also warmer parts of temperate zones (Roshevits 1980).  Within 
this large genus, two species are of economic importance; proso millet and to a 
lesser extent little millet (<I>P. miliare</I> L.).  The genus <I>Panicum</I> is
 poorly represented in drier tropics, apart from a few more or less xerophytic
 species (Cobley 1976).
<P>Proso, an ancient Slav name used in Russia and Poland (Candolle 1964), has 
also been called common millet, hog millet, broom corn, yellow hog,hershey, and
 white millet.  Although the origin of proso millet has not been ascertained, it
 is one of the first cultivated cereal grasses, most likely prior to wheat.
 Proso millet has been known for many thousands of years in Eastern Asia
 including China, India, and Russia.  The cultivation of proso is more generally
 thought to come from central and eastern Asia and spread to India, Russia, the
 Middle East, and Europe (Roshevits 1980).  Proso is still extensively
 cultivated in India, China, Russia, in the Middle East including Iran, Iraq,
 Syria, and Turkey, and also in Afghanistan and Romania (Martin et al. 1976).
 According to Matz (1986), however, proso is probably a native of Egypt and
 Arabia and has been cultivated in Asia Minor and southern Europe since
 prehistoric times.  Candolle (1964) also states that Egypto-Arabian origin of
 proso millet is very probable.
<P>The genus <I>Setaria</I> is widely distributed in warm and temperate areas.
 Foxtail millet is the most economically valuable of the genus.  Foxtail millet
 is one of the world's oldest cultivated crops.  Its planting has been mentioned
 in Chinese records as early as 2700 <FONT size="-1">BC</FONT> (Vinall 1924).  
<I>S. italica</I> was the most important plant food in the neolithic culture in 
China, and its domestication and cultivation was the earliest identifiable 
manifestation of this culture, the beginning of which has been estimated at over 
4,000 years ago (Chang 1968).  In Russia, foxtail millet has been cultivated 
since ancient times and there is evidence that it was grown as long as 1,500 
years ago (Movsisyants, 1950).  Malm and Rachi (1968) thoroughly reviewed the
 domestication of foxtail millets and the taxonomy.  They report the use of
 subspecies by Scholz (1960) based on papillae on the epidermal cells of the
 glumes (<I>moharia</I>) and no papillae (<I>maximas</I>).  Perhaps of more
 practical value was the breakout by Coleman (1939) based on head type and seed
 color.   
<H2><A name="BIOLOGY AND ADAPTATION">BIOLOGY AND ADAPTATION </A></H2>Proso 
millet is well adapted to many soil and climatic conditions.  Being a
 short-season crop with a low water requirement, it grows further north (up to
 54deg.N latitude) than the other millets and also adapts well to plateau
 conditions and high elevations (Theisen el al. 1978; Matz 1986).  Proso is
 found high in the mountains; in the former USSR up to 1200 m and in India up to
 3500 m (Roshevits 1980).  
<P>The proso plant is considered a short-day plant and usually an erect annual, 
30 to 100 cm tall with few tillers and an adventitious root system.  However,
 Anderson (1994) showed that 'Cope' proso millet development can be related to
 temperature by using growing degree days (GDD).  For proso, he used a base
 temperature of 10°C.  He showed that 'Cope' began tillering at 430 GDD and
 initiated flowering at 750 GDD.  This relationship needs to be confirmed for
 other cultivars.  
<P>Proso stems and leaves are covered with slight hairs.  The leaves may be up 
to 30 cm long with a short ligule but no auricles (Cobley 1976).  The stem is
 terminated by a drooping panicle 10 to 45 cm long that may be open or compact
 (Hulse et al. 1980).  Proso (2<I>n </I>= 36) is considered a self-pollinated
 crop, but natural cross-pollination may exceed 10% (Popov 1946).  Proso seeds
 are smaller than pearl millet and grain sorghum, generally oval in shape and
 about 3 mm long and 2 mm wide (Cardenas et al. 1983).  The seeds vary in color
 as white cream, yellow, orange, red, black to brown.  Growth and development
 characteristics of proso millet were explained in detail by Cardenas et al.
 (1983).  They distinguished three phases; vegetative, reproductive, and
 ripening, which may be further sub-divided into physiologically distinct
 stages.  The vegetative phase covers the period from germination to panicle
 initiation, depending on the cultivar used and climate in the area, may be
 completed 16 to 20 days after planting.  An increase in number of leaves,
 tiller buds, and plant height are characteristics of this phase.  The period,
 about 20 to 25 days, from panicle differentiation to flowering of the main culm
 is the reproduction phase.  This phase initiates when the panicle primordium is
 greater than 0.5 mm.  Rapid elongation of stem internodes and an increase in
 leaf area accompanied by more tillers are noticed in this phase.  The ripening
 phase starts at flowering or blooming and continues to the end of physiological
 maturity, which covers a period of 20 to 30 days.  Throughout this period, the
 plant actively accumulates dry matter, particularly in the grains.  Rodriques
 et al. (1990) studied the dry matter accumulation pattern of two cultivars of
 proso millet with optimum nutrient and water availability.  From anthesis to
 maturity, dry matter accumulated at a rate of 0.5 mg/ha-day.  Panicles at
 maturity accounted for 55% of the total plant dry matter, which is higher than
 for wheat and grain sorghum.  The authors concluded that since proso
 accumulates higher dry matter in the reproductive parts compared to wheat,
 maize, and sorghum, it may be advantageous to grow proso in dry and short
 growing seasons.  Physiological maturity proceeds from top to bottom of the
 panicle.  The ripening of the seed is not uniform throughout the panicle and
 delay in harvesting may cause losses due to shattering (Theisen et al. 1978;
 Baltensperger et al. 1995a).  The grains from the main panicle reach maximum
 dry weight and a small dark layer at the hilar region of the seed is formed. At 
maturity, the grain generally includes about 20% or less moisture. 
<P>Proso plants generally mature between 60-90 days after planting and can be
 grown successfully in poor soil and hot dry weather.  Proso is an easy crop to
 grow and it seems to be better adapted than most crops to primitive
 agricultural practices.  Under high-input conditions, however, it may be a poor
 choice because of low response to high fertility and abundant water
 (Baltensperger et al. 1995a).  
<P>Proso millet requires very little water, possibly the lowest water 
requirement of any cereal, and converts water most efficiently to dry 
matter/grain (Theisen et al. 1978; Hulse et al. 1980).  According to Arnon 
(1972), this is not because of its drought-resistance but because of its short 
growing season. Proso has a very low transpiration ratio, which may be 
attributed in part to the C4 photosynthetic mechanism (Martin et al. 1976).  The 
low straw grain ratio of proso also contributes to its water use efficiency and 
adaptation to moisture-limited areas.  Proso is very shallow rooted and does not 
grow well under water stress, nor under excess moisture.  Plants seem to 
tolerate more cold than most other C4 crops, especially sorghum, but will not 
tolerate frosts.  Moderately warm weather is necessary for germination of the 
seed and growth of the plant.  Proso germinates well at temperatures of 10deg. 
to 45°C, but does not germinate at 5° or 50°C.  The highest rate of germinations 
is between 35° and 40°C (Theisen et al. 1978).
<P>The feed value of proso has been studied with several classes of livestock.
 Luis et al. (1982a, b), investigated both broiler and turkey diets with proso.
 The turkey poults were significantly heavier at the end of the 28 day feeding
 period with proso than those on either corn or sorghum diets.  Broilers fed
 balanced diets of the three cereals were not significantly different in gains.
 When proso was evaluated in layer diets it was concluded that "proso millet,
 either ground or whole, is an excellent ingredient for layer diets" (Luis et
 al. 1982c).  Kies et al. (1975) investigated various millet mixes in human
 diets and discussed their potential.  The feed value of proso millet for cattle
 and swine is generally considered to equal that of grain sorghum or milo and
 maize when less than 50% of the maize in the ration is replaced (<A href="https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/V3-182.html#Table 2">Table 
2</A>).
<P>Growth and development of foxtail millet is well described by Malm and Rachie
 (1971).  A progressive shortening of the vegetative period occurs with later
 plantings, and stem elongation is determined by the length of the vegetative
 period.  Stem elongation was hastened by late sowing and was retarded by early
 sowing.  The transition from vegetative growth into inflorescence takes place
 very rapidly.  In the lower third of the cone of growth, initial humps of
 secondary axes appear following enlarged growth of the growing point, with the
 middle and upper parts still undifferentiated.  Later, secondary axes
 differentiate up to the very top into points of growth.  The inflorescence of
 foxtail millet has a main stalk with shortened side branches bearings spikes
 and bristles.  The first flowers of foxtail millet may open when three fourths
 of the panicle emerges from the sheath, or as many as five days after full
 emergence.  Flowering proceeds from the top of the head downward in each of the
 panicle branches.  A large head may take 8 to 16 days to compete flowering.  A
 single floret may remain open about 30 min, and about 80 min are required for
 the complete blooming process, which is hastened by high temperatures and low
 humidity (Malm and Rachie 1971).  The world's foxtail millet crop is grown
 largely in China, India, Russia, and the United States.  Foxtail millet is by
 far the most important millet species in China and is grown in Hopei, Horank,
 and Shansi provinces to a large extent and in most northern areas of China
 (Anderson and Martin 1949).  Foxtail millet grows in mountainous as well as
 plains regions.  It provided approximately 17% of the total food consumed in
 China (Malm and Rachie 1971).  Werth (1937) considered China or central Asia to
 be the center of origin of the cultivated varieties.  Many related species,
 with 2<I>n</I> levels as multiples of the 18 found in foxtail, occur in China.
 In Russia foxtail cultivars are grown up to 50°N.  Foxtail millet is grown
 primarily for hay in the United States.  The primary area is the Northern and
 Western Great Plains or High Plains, including Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,
 Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota.  It has been grown at elevations over
 1500 m in New Mexico.  Seed supplies for hay production are grown in the more
 southern portion of this region including Texas.  The seed can yield as much as
 proso but foxtail millet seeds are generally much smaller than proso millet
 seeds.  Foxtail millet has about 500,000 seeds/kg, or more than twice that of
 proso (Wietgrefe 1990).  Foxtail millet and proso millet both grow from a
 height of 0.5 to 2 m, but make little or no regrowth once they are cut.  They
 are generally cut for hay during the early heading stage.  Research on forage
 quality shows foxtail is similar in quality to other C4 annual grasses.  It is
 finer-stemmed and easier to cure than pearl millet or forage sorghum
 (Baltensperger 1992).  Malm and Rachie (1971) give tables of the relative feed
 value of foxtail millet and discuss its use as a human food and on animal
 performance.  A small amount of foxtail millet is grown and hand picked for
 millet sprays for the caged bird seed industry (Wietgrefe 1989). 
<H2><A name="BREEDING">BREEDING</A></H2>The floral morphology and breeding 
behavior of foxtail and proso millet make them two of the more difficult species 
to work with.  Nearly all foxtail millet cultivars grown in the United States 
are the result of selections from land races rather than designed crosses and 
selections.  Nelson (1981) selected and released the last registered cultivar, 
'Sno-Fox' for grain, but it has not been grown extensively.  A recent breeding 
program was initiated at the Univ. of Nebraska to incorporate wheat streak 
mosaic virus resistance into adapted material.  Melicio Siles, a graduate 
student working on the project has made many foxtail millet crosses by hand 
(Siles, et al. 1995).  However, in China, India, and the former USSR a great 
deal of foxtail millet breeding work has been done.  Genetic studies havebeen 
conducted on several morphological characters and disease response (Malm and 
Rachie 1971).  More recent work in the region has not been well reviewed in 
English literature, but numerous Chinese, Indian, and Russian scientists are 
working on foxtail breeding programs at the current time.  
<P>Proso breeding in the United States has been conducted at primarily two
 locations: the USDA program at Akron, Colorado, which was discontinued when Dr.
 Greg Heinz left in the late 1980s, and the Univ. of Nebraska program at the
 Panhandle Research and Extension Center.  Dr. Lenis Nelson developed crossing
 techniques for proso at this location and produced the first cultivar from a
 hand-made cross ('Rise'), in 1984 (Nelson 1984a, b).  Since that time, several
 cultivars have been released from this program that are currently grown on the
 majority of U.S. millet hectorage (Nelson 1990a; Baltensperger et al. 1995a,
 b).  Recent work has emphasized the development of increased seed size (Kara
 1992).  A wider choice of proso cultivars is available today than ever before
 in the U.S., but most of the high yield, white seed, strong straw types have
 `Dawn' as one parent in their pedigree, so germplasm base may be narrower than
 expected.  Nearly all proso grown in the major production areas is
 white-seeded.  Red-seeded proso has some demand, but probably is best grown
 away from the usual production areas and with a contract or specific market
 identified.  A yearly update of cultivars can be found in the Nebraska
 Cooperative Extension Publication, EC 107, (Nebraska Proso and Sunflower
 Variety Tests).  The average proso yield in Nebraska is approximately 2 t/ha
 (Baltensperger et al. 1994).
<P>Three cultivars (Sunrise, Huntsman, and Earlybird) were released in 1994 and
 1995.  'Sunrise' is a joint release of the Univ. of Nebraska and USDA
 (Baltensperger et al. 1994).  It is large, white-seeded, with excellent yield
 potential, intermediate in maturity, excellent lodging tolerance, and is
 expected to replace 'Sunup' in most growing areas.  'Huntsman' is also a joint
 release of the University of Nebraska and USDA.  It is a large, white-seeded
 cultivar with excellent yield potential, late in maturity, excellent lodging
 tolerance, and is expected to replace 'Cope' in most growing areas.  'Huntsman'
 is shorter than 'Cope' (Baltensperger et al. 1995c).  'Earlybird' was released
 by the University of Nebraska.  It is a large, white-seed cultivar with
 excellent yield potential.  It is early in maturity, has excellent lodging
 tolerance, and is expected to replace 'Dawn' and 'Rise' in most growing areas
 (Baltensperger et al. 1995b).  'Sunup' is a 1989 release from Nebraska (Nelson
 1990b).  It is a white-seeded cultivar similar to 'Dawn' and 'Rise'.  'Sunup'
 is as lodging resistant as 'Dawn' and 'Rise' and is larger seeded than 'Rise'.
 It is less susceptible to seed shattering than the common proso cultivars.
 'Sunup' has replaced 'Rise' as the most commonly grown cultivar in the United
 States.  The newer releases are all larger seeded, but have a similar panicle
 type.  Several other distinct types of proso are available.  'Panhandle' from
 Nebraska, 'Minco' from Minnesota, and 'Abarr' from Colorado are all similar to
 the original common white (Baltensperger et al. 1995a).  Although these
 cultivars differ slightly in height, yielding ability, and maturity, they have
 white seed and are readily marketed though normal channels in the proso growing
 areas.  They all have fairly open panicles and suffer from lodging and seed
 shattering.  
<P>A second type with acceptable white seed is 'Minsum', which was developed in
 Minnesota as an early maturing cultivar with a very loose panicle type.
 Colorado State Univ. developed a tall, late maturing cultivar, 'Cope', that has
 acceptable white seed.  Due to its maturity, 'Cope' is likely best adapted to
 relatively longer growing seasons.  University of Nebraska released 'Dawn', a
 very short, very early cultivar with a tight panicle.  It has a superior white
 grain, but is inferior agronomically because of its height (Nelson 1976).
 Because of its earliness, shatter resistance, seed size, and lodging tolerance
 it has been used extensively as a parent in breeding programs.  
<P>If red seed is desired, the two choices are 'Cerise', an early maturing
 cultivar from Nebraska, or 'Red Leonard', a tall, late maturing cultivar from
 Colorado.  'Red Leonard' has superior yield if planted early.  Both have
 smaller seed size and are less acceptable as a feed due to a higher tannin
 content.  Bird seed manufacturers use small amounts of red proso to improve eye
 appeal of the final product.   
<H2><A name="CULTIVATION">CULTIVATION</A></H2>One of the most critical periods 
in growing either proso or foxtail millet is the two weeks after planting.  Both 
millets grow very slowly during the first few weeks and they are relatively poor 
weed competitors resulting in unsatisfactory yield on weedy land.  Control of 
weeds prior to planting by herbicides or tillage is critical to good yields.  A 
good seedbed preparation is important in growing these millets and the seedbed 
should be moist, firm, weed free, and have adequate nutrients to permit a good 
stand and seedling development.  The advantage to the no-till system is greatest 
at this time as reseeding because crusting is seldom required.  
<P>Proso and foxtail millet usually follow in the spring after wheat has been
 harvested.  Both may be planted late as catch crops to replace winter wheat
 that has been destroyed due to winterkilling, blowing, or hail.  Hail storms
 usually occur after May 15.  An attempt is made to plant as soon as the soil is
 dry enough.  Three problems prevail under these circumstances.  First, wheat
 has taken a considerable amount of moisture from the soil profile; second,
 decaying wheat residue interferes with proso growth; and third, residual
 herbicide from the wheat crop may persist and injure the millet.  Generally, in
 a wheat-fallow rotation it is more desirable to plant millet into fallow
 intended for wheat planting in the fall and to utilize the hailed wheat land
 for fall winter wheat planting.  In yield studies conducted in the Nebraska
 Panhandle, proso yields were more than doubled by using available fallow ground
 for seeding compared with planting into hailed-out wheat land.  The increase of
 more than 1,000 kg/ha would increase gross returns more than $120/ha using a
 price of $0.12/kg.  The advantage of using the fallow ground is the soil
 moisture at planting.  The danger with this strategy is that hailed wheat land
 may not store sufficient moisture to provide successful seeding of winter wheat
 in the fall (Baltensperger et al. 1995a).
<P>The millets can also replace summer crops late in the season when they have
 poor germination or are destroyed due to early drought, late spring frost,
 hail, or insects, providing a good chance of obtaining a crop.  In
 moisture-limited areas of the central Great Plains, proso is often well adapted
 to winter wheat-proso-fallow rotation and gives an extra cash crop every three
 years.  Shanahan et al. (1988) compared three different crop rotations;
 millet-millet, winter wheat-millet, and fallow-millet for the productivity and
 water use of proso in the central Great Plains.  Over the 5-year period of
 study, the wheat-millet and fallow-millet out yielded the millet-millet 50% and
 116% in grain yield, respectively.  Lyon and Baltensperger (1995) and Higgins
 et al. (1994) showed the value of including millet in a rotation with winter
 wheat for the control of winter-annual grass weeds.  
<P>Several methods of seedbed preparation, as outlined by Baltensperger et al.
 (1995a) are available to farmers growing proso millet.  Work by Nelson and
 Fenster (1983) and Anderson (1990) show that management within a technique is
 probably more important than the technique.  No-till systems were becoming
 dominant in the High Plains prior to proso being dropped from the atrazine
 label.  The dropping of the highly tolerant crop from the label is
 representative of the problems in working with minor crops.  Atrazine at the
 use rates found in proso (less than 0.5 kg/ha) is seldom an environmental
 problem in dryland areas with more than 20 m to the water table.  Alternative
 strategies to grow no-till proso require several applications of alternative
 herbicides.  The loss of atrazine labeling in proso has increased management
 demands and the cost of proso production (Baltensperger et al. 1995a).
<P>In general, proso and foxtail millet do not respond consistently to the
 addition of nitrogen fertilizer.  If a full year of fallow precedes the millet,
 fertilizer is not generally recommended except on the poorest soils (soil test
 with less than 25 ppm in upper 0.5 m).  But, when proso follows wheat, it is
 generally recommended that 45 kg/ha of nitrogen be applied (Baltensperger et
 al. 1995a).  Chadhari and Rai (1982) suggest that 40 kg N, 20 kg P and 20 kg
 K/ha used for obtaining a good crop of proso under irrigated conditions in
 India.  Higher rates typically lead to lodging.  Proso currently has an upper
 yield plateau around 5 t/ha because of a lack of straw strength.  Yield limits
 may be higher in more tropically adapted foxtail millets.
<P>Proso millet has a very long planting period and it is often used for 
replacing dead winter crops or unsuccessful early spring crops.  If good weed 
control is practiced, taking better advantage of spring rains, the earlier dates 
will produce better yields.  In western Nebraska, proso can produce a seed crop 
when planted as early as May 15 or as late as July 5.  Nelson (1990a), using 
three different cultivars of proso, evaluated influence of planting date on 
grain yield and other agronomic traits of proso millet at six-year location 
sites in western Nebraska.  The results indicated that planting date of May 15 
and June 1 were optimal for grain yield.  Foxtail millet cultivars are more 
variable in maturity than available proso cultivars and some will not mature if 
planted after June 15 ('White Wonder', 'Golden German' and others), but since 
most are grown for hay, the practical planting window may be extended to July 15 
and still produce a good hay crop.  
<P>It is generally accepted that narrow rows (&lt;30cm) are beneficial in 
reducing weed competition and increasing yield (Nelson 1977; Agdag 1995).  The 
equipment used to plant millet is usually dictated by the equipment available 
for other crops.  The most common drill is one used for winter wheat, usually a 
deep furrow or hoe-opener type.  This is not the most desirable type since it is
 difficult to maintain a shallow depth with it.  When a hoe drill is used, the
 rate is set high (17 kg/ha) and the depth is quite shallow.  The packerwheels
 can be very beneficial if planting into a loose seedbed, but that combination
 is most susceptible to crusting from a heavy rainstorm (Baltensperger et al.
 1995).  The most desirable drill for planting proso where stubble is not a
 problem is double-disk drill.  It can place the seed into a shallow slot and
 firm the soil around it.  It leaves very little furrow to wash in and crust in
 the event of a heavy rainstorm.  The final drill type is one designed for
 no-till wheat.  Regardless of the type of equipment used, it is necessary to
 have the seed firmly packed and covered with 1 to 2 cm of soil.  Nebraska
 studies showed that choice of drills did not greatly affect yield if a good job
 of seeding was accomplished (Nelson 1990a).  
<P>Ripening is not uniform throughout the panicle in proso.  Frequently the 
seeds in the upper portion of the panicle are ripe while the lower seeds are 
still green (Matz 1986).  A delay in harvesting until the grain has dried
 sufficiently for threshing will cause considerable losses due to shattering. It 
is generally recommended that swathing be done when most of the panicle has lost 
its green color.  Threshing can the be delayed until the grain is below 13% 
moisture (Baltensperger et al. 1995a).  Foxtail heads ripen more uniformly and 
are less subject to shatter, but frequently have tillers that are significantly 
different in maturity.  Foliage is still green at maturity so it is generally 
swathed prior to combining
<P>The primary limitation on foxtail millet production in the High Plains is not
 actually a serious problem for foxtail millet itself.  It is that it serves as
 a carrier for both the wheat curl mite, <I>Eriophyes tullipae</I> Keifer, the
 carrier for wheat streak mosaic virus and the virus itself.  While adapted
 cultivars of foxtail are not seriously impacted by the disease, the crop serves
 as an over-summering host and adjacent wheat fields are frequently severely
 impacted.  Recent research by Marcon (1994) has identified germplasm with much
 higher levels of resistance that may help to expand the utilization of foxtail
 millet in the region.  Proso has been immune to this disease and is the primary
 reason it is utilized on a larger scale.  However, one of the weeds in many
 proso fields is green foxtail <I>Setaria viridis</I> which can cause the same
 problems in wheat fields adjacent to proso fields.  Management can be utilized
 to reduce the severity of the problem by harvesting the proso early enough that
 no living material is present for at least 2 weeks prior to wheat planting.  
<H2><A name="MARKETS">MARKETS</A></H2>Proso millet is the primary millet in the 
world import and export market (Wietgrefe 1989).  The bulk of proso sold in the 
cash trade is marketed through elevators in the counties where it is grown most 
extensively.  The grain is cleaned further, processed, and used for bird seed.  
Both domestic and wild bird seed is packaged by adding other grains for color 
and nutrition.  Some proso goes through a dehulling process and supplies both 
human and animal needs.  Some is exported and some used for specialty purposes, 
such as mushroom production.  Proso is the only millet of quantity involved in 
world trade. Proso prices have historically been higher than maize or sorghum 
(<A 
href="https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/V3-182.html#Fig. 1">Fig. 
1</A>) but this varies dramatically from season to season.  When the premium 
human food and bird seed markets are saturated, the price quickly drops to feed 
grain values.  Proso prices have ranged from $0.05 to $0.55 per kg over 5-year
 period.  In a period of increased crop area, more grain is produced than the
 markets can absorb.  This excess also includes grain produced outside the
 traditional marketing area.  The hay market is more local because of
 transportation costs for both foxtail and proso millet.  The potential for
 foxtail as a dryland feed grain is severely underdeveloped.  
<P>The International Sorghum and Millet Project has specifically excluded 
research on these two species.  As a result, even though foxtail and proso 
millet have been more significant in U.S. agriculture and are a significant food 
source for millions of people, much less research has occurred on them during 
the past ten years than on pearl millet in the United States.  The politics of 
minor crops continues to be a significant factor to overcome in their 
development, but the potential remains high for both foxtail and proso millet.
