<p class="msonormal">Fourteen different growth stages are given for a corn 
 plant. A plant is determined to be at a specific growth stage when 50% 
 of the plants in the field have reached the stage under consideration. 
 They are listed here and include:</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Seeding<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (S) to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Emergence<?rh-glo_end ?> (E) 
 – the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>seedling<?rh-glo_end ?> emerges 
 from the soil.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">Vegetative growth:</p>
<p class="msonormal">E to 4<sup>th</sup> Leaf (V4) – emergence of the seedling 
 has occurred and four <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>leaves<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 are present each with a visible leaf <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>collar<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 This is one of the vegetative stages.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tassel<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when tassels are initiated.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Ear<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when ears are initiated. 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Ear Initiation<?rh-glo_end ?>, <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>tassel initiation<?rh-glo_end ?>, <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>tiller<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 initiation and internode elongation starts all occur at approximately 
 the same time.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V4 to Internode Elongation Begins – the vegetative 
 stage continues to when the internodes between leaves begin to elongate. 
 That is, the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>stem<?rh-glo_end ?> begins 
 to lengthen. This also, occurs at about the same time as the two previous 
 stages plus <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>tiller initiation<?rh-glo_end ?>.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V4 to 12<sup>th</sup> Leaf (V12) – vegetative growth 
 continues resulting in 12 leaves with visible leaf collars. </p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V12 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Tasseling<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 – tassels are visible at this stage.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal"><?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Grain filling<?rh-glo_end ?>:</p>

<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">V12 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Silking<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R1) – this occurs at about the same time as tasseling and indicates a 
 shift in the plant from vegetative growth to reproductive stages. The 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>silks<?rh-glo_end ?> are the functional 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>stigma<?rh-glo_end ?> of the <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>female flower<?rh-glo_end ?> and develop from the ovules. 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Pollen<?rh-glo_end ?> grains are released 
 by the male flowers and when captured by the silks, germinate and develop 
 pollen tubes that penetrate the silk tissue. The germinated pollen grains 
 or male gametes travel down the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>pollen 
 tube<?rh-glo_end ?> and fertilize the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>ovule<?rh-glo_end ?>. 
 The ovules closest to the base of the ear develop silks first and silking 
 proceeds up the ear to the tip.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R1 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Blister<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R2) – this is the second reproductive stage and the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>kernels<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 appear as whitish blisters on the cob. They contain much clear fluid and 
 some starch.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R2 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Milk<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R3) – by this stage the kernels contain a milky white fluid and the kernels 
 are mostly yellow. Starch continues to accumulate.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R3 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Dough<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R4) – the kernel’s fluid is a <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>soft 
 dough<?rh-glo_end ?> due to starch accumulation which continues in this 
 stage. The kernels now have about 50% of their mature dry weight.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R4 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Dent<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 (R5) – the kernels show a dent in the crown. There is also a <?rh-glo_start 
 class="glossterm"?>milk line<?rh-glo_end ?> which is the boundary between 
 the milk and starch layers. The milk line is near the dent end of the 
 kernel &#160;and progresses to the tip end of the kernel over approximately 
 three weeks.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R5 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Maturity<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 R6) – at this stage the kernels are at their maximum dry weight and are 
 considered to be physiologically mature. This occurs just after the milk 
 line disappears and just before the <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>black 
 layer<?rh-glo_end ?> forms at the tip of the kernel.</p>
<p class="msonormal">&#160;</p>
<p class="msonormal">R6 to <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Harvest Ready<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 – the kernels are ready for harvest when their moisture content has decreased 
 to near 25%. Minimal damage will occur during harvest.</p>

<p>The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Corn 
 hybrids which are divided based on Days in which they are expected to 
 reach maturity given normal growing conditions. The hybrids here range 
 from 90-Day to 120 Day. The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Generic<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>hybrid<?rh-glo_end ?> is considered 
 to be the same as the 110-Day hybrid.</p>

<p>The <?rh-glo_start class="glossterm"?>Run<?rh-glo_end ?>... button executes 
 the program with the selections that have been chosen.</p>

<p>The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original,
