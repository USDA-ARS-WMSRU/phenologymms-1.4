PhenologyMMS provides four methods, although default parameters for each crop are available for only one specific method. For example, parameters for Method 1 are provided for winter wheat  while parameters for Method 2 for are provided for corn. A description of each of the Methods follows.\n \nGDD Method 1 - this is a very common and simple method of calculating GDD. GDD is calculated by summing the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and the daily minimum temperature (Tmin), dividing that result by two to estimate the daily average temperature (Tavg), and then subtracting the base temperature (Tbase) from Tavg. Tbase is the temperature below which the process of interest does not progress.\n     Tavg = ((Tmax + Tmin)/2)\n     GDD = (Tavg - Tbase)\n     Note: GDD >= 0 (i.e., cannot be negative). If the GDD value is less than zero, it is set equal to 0.0.\n \nMethod 1 is commonly used for small grains such as wheat, barley and millet.\n \nGDD Method 2 - this method is a slight variation of GDD Method 1. The differences are: a) adding an upper temperature threshold (Tupper), which limits the amount of GDD that can be accumulated for the day, and b) adjusting Tmax and Tmin for each day based on the base (Tbase) and upper (Tupper) thresholds as follows. Both Tmax and Tmin are compared to Tbase and if Tmax and/or Tmin is less than Tbase then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to Tbase. Likewise, if Tmax and/or Tmin is greater than Tupper, then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to Tupper. The average temperature is calculated and Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. If the resulting value is less than zero, then it is set to zero.\n \nMethod Two is used for Corn, Dry Beans, Sorghum, Soybean, and Sunflower.\n \nGDD Method 3 - this method employs a two-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to an Optimum Temperature (Topt), and the second segment extends from Topt to Tupper. The Average temperature is calculated and compared to Tbase and Topt. If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and less than or equal to Topt, then a temperature factor (tf), which uses the slope of the first segment of the line, is calculated and multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase. This gives the GDD value for the day. However, if the Tavg is greater than Topt and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf', which uses the slope of the second segment of the line, is multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase to give today's GDD value. If neither comparisons are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then the GDD for the day is zero. \n  \nGDD Method 4 - this method uses a three-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo); the second segment from Toptlo to the Upper Optimum Temperature (Toptup); the third segment runs from Toptup to Tupper. The Average temperature (Tavg) is calculated and compared to Tbase and the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo). If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and if Tavg is less than Toptlo, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. This value is multiplied by the calculated temperature factor, 'tf' which is calculated using the slope of this first segment of the line to get the GDD value for the day. However, if Tavg is greater than or equal to Toptlo and less than or equal to Toptup, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg and that value is multiplied by 'tf' which has been calculated using the slope of the second line segment (which is 1). This gives the GDD value for the day. If Tavg is greater than Toptup and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf' is calculated using the slope of the third segment of the line and is multiplied by the result of Tavg minus Tbase to yield the GDD value for the day. If none of the situations are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then GDD for the day is set equal to zero.\n \nAll methods calculate thermal time as described above, however Methods 3 and 4 add another modifier to the thermal time calculation which assumes that not all temperatures between Tbase and the maximum temperature have the same effect on plant development. For example, temperatures at the optimum level (Method 3), or in the optimum range (Method 4) result in faster development than those near Tbase or the maximum temperature. Therefore, the calculated thermal time is then reduced by the 0-1 development rate factor (shown on the y-axis) to calculate the final thermal time for the day. Adding this development rate factor is often considered theoretically more correct, but often in practice for field conditions does not result in significant improvement in accuracy for many reasons. Further, it adds additional parameters for optimum temperature (or range) and uses a simple linear relationship. The figures for Methods 3 and 4 also show a curvilinear relationship for calculating thermal time and the development rate factor, but this approach has not been incorporated into PhenologyMMS.\n \n \nGDD Methods Figure  (McMaster, G.

It contains the appropriate growth stages for the crop and provides two ways to determine which growth stage the plant is in. The image below displays the Generic variety of Winter Wheat.\n \n \n \n\n \n \nThe left hand side of the screen contains parameters for each stage using Growing Degree Days (GDD), i.e., thermal time, in a non-stressed environment comparable to an irrigated field and a stressed environment analogous to a dryland or rainfed operation.\n \nThe two columns on the right hand side of the screen show the number of leaves added at each growth stage based on the phyllochron entered for the crop on the Temperatures screen in the \"Growing Degree-Days per Leaf\" edit box, again under non-stressed and stressed conditions. These values are editable.  \n \nIf the user has a better estimate of the number of GDD for a stage or stages or for the number of leaves in any of the four columns, they may enter that value for the appropriate stage.  Rarely, is a crop completely stressed or completely non-stressed so an intermediate value may be a better choice in either the stressed or the non-stressed column - whichever one the user feels the crop is closest to under current conditions. A combination of selections can be used. For example, a user might select some number of growth stage values in the non-stressed column while the plant/crop is not stressed and then select growth stage values in the stressed column when the plant/crop is likely to encounter stressful growing conditions. The same applies to the Number of Leaves columns if the user is using this method to determine when a growth stage is reached. It is possible to use any combination of all four columns. Note: if the GDD value for a stage is changed, the number of leaves for that stage does not update.\n \nThe other selection the user will want to make is the Variety. Different crops have differing numbers of varieties available in the Variety drop-down box. At the least, there are always four varieties: Generic, Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Late Maturity. The Medium Maturity variety is equal to the Generic variety. Corn is the exception to this standard. Corn is presented in terms of 'Days', e.g., '110 Day', which indicates the approximate days to maturity. For some crops, additional named varieties or plant type varieties are given. Spring Barley and Spring Wheat add additional varieties based on the total number of leaves expected, e.g., '8-leaved;.

URL: https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/GrainFill.html  Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.'.\n \nV12 to Silking (R1) – this occurs at about the same time as tasseling and indicates a shift in the plant from vegetative growth to reproductive stages. The silks are the functional stigma of the female flower and develop from the ovules. Pollen grains are released by the male flowers and when captured by the silks, germinate and develop pollen tubes that penetrate the silk tissue. The germinated pollen grains or male gametes travel down the pollen tube and fertilize the ovule. The ovules closest to the base of the ear develop silks first and silking proceeds up the ear to the tip.\n \nR1 to Blister (R2) – this is the second reproductive stage and the kernels appear as whitish blisters on the cob. They contain much clear fluid and some starch.\n \nR2 to Milk (R3) – by this stage the kernels contain a milky white fluid and the kernels are mostly yellow. Starch continues to accumulate.\n \nR3 to Dough (R4) – the kernel’s fluid is a soft dough due to starch accumulation which continues in this stage. The kernels now have about 50% of their mature dry weight.\n \nR4 to Dent (R5) – the kernels show a dent in the crown. There is also a milk line which is the boundary between the milk and starch layers. The milk line is near the dent end of the kernel  and progresses to the tip end of the kernel over approximately three weeks.\n \nR5 to Maturity R6) – at this stage the kernels are at their maximum dry weight and are considered to be physiologically mature. This occurs just after the milk line disappears and just before the black layer forms at the tip of the kernel.\n \nR6 to Harvest Ready – the kernels are ready for harvest when their moisture content has decreased to near 25%. Minimal damage will occur during harvest.\n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen.\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Corn hybrids which are divided based on Days in which they are expected to reach maturity given normal growing conditions. The hybrids here range from 90-Day to 120 Day. The Generic hybrid is considered to be the same as the 110-Day hybrid.\n \nThe Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.\n \nThe Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.\n \n \nLinks to the Phenology Diagram and the Developmental Sequence for

Ecological Modelling 68:183-203). Four soil water levels are available and the user inputs the condition of the soil at planting time. The GDD required for germination increases and the elongation rate decreases as water content decreases. After planting, precipitation can shift the soil moisture condition upwards toward Optimum but there is no provision reducing the soil moisture level due to evaporation.\n \nThe four soil moisture levels are: Optimum, Medium, Dry and Planted in Dust. These are shown for Winter Wheat in Table 1 below which is found in Table 2 in the reference cited above. Other input parameters include the lower and upper Water-filled pore space (wfpslo and wfpsup), Germination time (germgdd), and Elongation rate (ergdd).\n \nDaily precipitation is read in from the weather file and is given in mm.\n \nSeeds planted in soil water conditions considered to be ‘Planted in Dust’ are assumed to not begin the germination process until some minimal soil water level is reached (i.e., 'Dry' conditions). Therefore, seeds Planted in Dust must move up to the Dry soil moisture level before beginning the accumulation of thermal time required for germination. At least seven mm or more of precipitation must be received before soil moisture can move from Planted in Dust to Dry conditions.\n \nIn order to provide a more realistic process of germination, two intermediate soil moisture levels were added. These occur between Optimum and Medium and between Medium and Dry. These were necessary because germination was occurring too rapidly with only the four soil moisture conditions named above.\n \nOnce germination has occurred, the elongation rate of the coleoptile (ergdd) is increased based on the input elongation rate in mm per growing degree-day for the soil moisture condition. This value is multiplied by the day’s growing degree-day value and added to the elongation length already achieved. Once the elongation length is greater than the planting depth, emergence has occurred.\n \nTABLE 1  (from Table 2 in the Ref. cited above)\n \nSeed germination and seedling elongation rates for

A description of each stage follows.\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the young seedling pushes through the soil to the soil surface.\n \nE to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.\n \nE to Single Ridge (SR) - single ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordium resulting in the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to End Spikelet Initiation (ESI) - spikelet primordium continue to be initiated until the end of spikelet initiation.\n \nESI to Jointing (J) - jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot. The developing head can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible.

Many users and farmers in particular need this information as many management decisions are based on the growth stage of the crop. This helps to enhance economic crop yields and at the same time maintain environmental quality. For example, as water for agriculture becomes increasingly more limited it will be critical to know the developmental stage the crop is at so the grower knows when the best times are to apply water. Simulation models and decision support tools also benefit by having crop simulation models which predict the timing of growth stages.\n \nPlant development is orderly and predictable, (Rickman and Klepper, 1995; McMaster, 2005) and the plant’s genetics determines the sequence of the growth stage events (Distelfeld et al., 2009; Moragues and McMaster, 2012). Environmental conditions also influence the plant’s development rate and includes such things as temperature, water availability, nutrients, photoperiod, etc. (White et al., 2008). Temperature has been used most frequently to predict the timing of developmental events and often uses some measurement of thermal time. Another very important influence on crop development is water availability, however many models do not include this impact on development. “Confounding the problem of variable phenological responses to water deficits is that for most crops the complete developmental sequence of the shoot apex has not been completely summarized and quantified or correlated with readily observable developmental stages.”(McMaster et al., 2013).\n \nPhenologyMMS 1.4 employs temperature as thermal time and water stress to predict the development of the crop and the timing of phenological growth stages.\n \nInstall PhenologyMMS 1.4 to begin using the model.\n \n \nLinks to: Install PhenologyMMS 1.4\n               Launch PhenologyMMS 1.4\n               Run PhenologyMMS 1.4\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"Growth_Stages_Example.htm#Growth_Stages_Example","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Growth_Stages_Example.htm"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Proso Millet Growth Stages.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Proso Millet Growth Stages.jpg"},{"origLink":"Proso_Millet_Diagrams.htm#Phenology_Diagram","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Proso_Millet_Diagrams.htm"},{"origLink":"Proso_Millet_Diagrams.htm#Developmental_Sequence","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Proso_Millet_Diagrams.htm"}],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Glossary":["<span id=\"dscexpitem_-181603605_3\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Panicum \n miliaceum</span>","Growth \n Stages","Seeding","Emergence","germination","seedling","Tiller","Single Ridge","SR","shoot apex","development","Double Ridge","DR","spikelet","primordium","End Spikelet Initiation","ESI","Jointing","node","head","stem","Flag Leaf Complete","FLC","flag leaf","whorl","ligule","sheath","booting","Heading","Anthesis Starts","AS","Anthers","pollination","Maturity","kernels","watery \n ripe","milky ripe","dough","Harvest Ready","Early Maturity","Medium Maturity","Generic","Late Maturity","Run"],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages"},{"id":"dscexpitem_-181603605_3","tagName":"span","innerText":"Panicum \n miliaceum"}],"Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Title":"Proso Millet Growth Stages","Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::Keywords":"proso Millet, Growth Stages, Emergence, Leaves, Anthesis, Maturity, Harvest Ready","Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Emergence,Emergence:Seeding,Maturity,Maturity:AS,DR,DR:End Spikelet Initiation,SR,SR:Double Ridge,Jointing,Jointing:ESI,Double Ridge,Double Ridge:SR,Seeding,Seeding:Emergence,Heading,Heading:FLC,Anthesis Starts,Developmental Sequence,Developmental Sequence:Proso Millet,First Tiller,AS,AS:Maturity,Single Ridge,FLC,FLC:Heading,Growth Stages,Flag Leaf Complete,Phenology Diagram,Harvest Ready,Medium Maturity,Early Maturity,Generic,Late Maturity,Growth Stages Example,Proso Millet,Proso Millet:Developmental Sequence,ESI,ESI:Jointing,End Spikelet Initiation,End Spikelet Initiation:DR,Proso Millet Growth Stages","Path::contents/Proso_Millet_Growth_Stages.htm::InnerText":"\nProso \n Millet Growth Stages\nThe Proso Millet (Panicum \n miliaceum L.)

Moench) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Medium variety which is analogous to the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \nSorghum has eleven growth stages depicted in PhenologyMMS which follow those of winter wheat with a few differences.\n \nA more generalized view of sorghum divides its growth into three stages. The first stage (GS I) is when vegetative growth occurs, the second stage (GS II) is when the reproductive structures are formed and the third stage (GS III) is devoted to grain ripening.\n \nA description of the stages in PhenologyMMS follows:\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the young seedling pushes through to the soil surface making the coleoptile visible.\n \nE to First Tiller (TI)) - the first tiller emerges and occurs at the four and six-leaf stage.\n \nTI to Growing Point Differentiation (GPD) - the growing point differentiates or changes from producing leaves to producing reproductive structures, i.e., the head.\n \nGPD  to Internode Elongation Starts (IES) - the internode begins to elongate.\n \nIES to Jointing (J) - jointing occurs when the first node is present. However, this is not externally visible in sorghum.\n \nJ to End of Leaf Growth (ELG) - the end of leaf growth occurs when the flag leaf has emerged from the whorl, the collar of the flag leaf is visible and all leaves are fully expanded. The head is nearly full size and is enclosed in the sheath of the flag leaf. The plant is now in the boot stage.\n \nELG to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the peduncle pushes the panicle from the flag leaf sheath. Heading has occurred when 50% of the plants have a visible panicle. Flowering or anthesis starts or first bloom starts from the tip of the head and progresses down the panicle.\n \nFirst Bloom (AS) to Half Bloom (HB) - the head is considered to be at half bloom when flowering has progressed halfway down the panicle; the field is at half-bloom when 50% of the plants in the field are at some stage of bloom.\n \nHB to Full Bloom (FB) - the heads of the plants are fully bloomed.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - this stage covers the beginning of flowering through the development of the kernels into mature grain. This encompasses the milk, soft dough and hard dough stages of the kernel. The grain is physiologically mature when the black layer appears above the point where the kernel was attached in the florets near the kernel base.\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernel needs to dry down before reaching harvest ready. When the moisture content is 20%, the grain can be harvested but it is better to dry to 14% to safely store the grain in bins when drying equipment is not available.\n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Sorghum varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity. There are four varieties and include Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity.\n \nThe Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.\n \nThe Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.\n \n \nLinks to the Phenology Diagram and the Developmental Sequence for Sorghum.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"Growth_Stages_Example.htm#Growth_Stages_Example","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Growth_Stages_Example.htm"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Soybean Growth Stages.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Soybean Growth Stages.jpg"},{"origLink":"http://corn.agronomy.wisc.edu/Crops/Soybean/L004.aspx","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"relPath":"http://corn.agronomy.wisc.edu/Crops/Soybean/L004.aspx"},{"origLink":"Soybean_Diagrams.htm#Phenology_Diagram","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Soybean_Diagrams.htm"},{"origLink":"Soybean_Diagrams.htm#Developmental_Sequence","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Soybean_Diagrams.htm"}],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Glossary":["Growth Stages","Seeding","Emergence","germination","primary root","hypocotyl","leaves","Cotyledonary Leaves","Trifoliate Leaf","node","axil","indeterminate","reproductive phase","Bloom","Flowering","main stem","Pod","Seed","physiological maturity","Harvest Ready","Early Maturity","Medium Maturity","Generic","Late Maturity","Maturity Group","Run"],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Soybean_Growth_Stages","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Soybean_Growth_Stages"}],"Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Title":"Soybean Growth Stages","Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::Keywords":"Soybean, Growth Stages, Emergence, Leaves, Anthesis, Maturity, Harvest Ready","Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Emergence,Emergence:Seeding,Seeding,Seeding:Emergence,Developmental Sequence,Developmental Sequence:Soybean,Growth Stages,Phenology Diagram,Harvest Ready,Harvest Ready:R8,Full Bloom,Full Bloom:R1,Medium Maturity,See:Growth Stages Example,Early Maturity,Generic,Late Maturity,R4,R4:Beginning Seed,R5,R5:Full Seed,R3,R3:Full Pod,R2,R2:Beginning Pod,R1,R1:Full Bloom,V12,V12:V8,V4,V4:4th Trifoliate Leaf,V4:5th Trifoliate Leaf,Growth Stages Example,V8,V8:V12,R8,R8:Harvest Ready,R6,R6:Beginning Maturity,R7,R7:Full Maturity,V1,V1:2nd Trifoliate Leaf,VC,VC:1st Trifoliate Leaf,3rd Trifoliate Leaf,3rd Trifoliate Leaf:V2,4th Trifoliate Leaf,4th Trifoliate Leaf:V4,V3,2nd Trifoliate Leaf,2nd Trifoliate Leaf:V1,V2,V2:3rd Trifoliate Leaf,Cotyledonary Leaves,1st Trifoliate Leaf,1st Trifoliate Leaf:VC,Bloom,Bloom:Beginning,VN,Soybean,Soybean:Developmental Sequence,V17,V17:V11,V16,V16:V25,V10,V10:V7,Full Seed,Full Seed:R5,Beginning Seed,Beginning Seed:R4,Full Maturity,Full Maturity:R7,V7,V7:V10,V15,V15:V23,V11,V11:V17,V23,V23:V15,V5,V13,V13:V20,Beginning Pod,Beginning Pod:R2,VE,Trifoliate,Trifoliate:set,V20,V20:V13,MG 000.5,MG 000.5:MG 10.5,MG 10.5,MG 10.5:MG 000.5,5th Trifoliate Leaf,5th Trifoliate Leaf:V4,Soybean Growth Stages,Full Pod,Full Pod:R3,V25,V25:V16,Beginning Maturity,Beginning Maturity:R6,Beginning,Beginning:Bloom,Set,Set:Trifoliate,R5.5,Maturity Group","Path::contents/Soybean_Growth_Stages.htm::InnerText":"\nSoybean Growth Stages\nThe Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Err.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n \n\n \nThere are sixteen growth stages for Soybean. The descriptions of the growth stages below came from this University of Wisconsin reference for Soybean.\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs .The primary root grows downward and the hypocotyl emerges from the soil pulling the two cotyledons with it. The cotyledons are unifoliate leaves. This is also known as VE.\n \nE to Cotyledonary Leaves - the hypocotyl straightens out and the cotyledons unfold and expand. This is the beginning of the VC stage and the vegetative phase.\n \nVC to 1st Trifoliate Leaf (V1) - the first set of two Trifoliate leaves appear. They originate from the second node. The first node was the unifoliate node.\n \nV1 to 2nd Trifoliate Leaf (V2) - the second set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the third node creating the V2 stage.\n \nV2 to 3rd Trifoliate Leaf (V3) - the third set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fourth node for the V3 stage.\n \nV3 to 4th Trifoliate Leaf (V4) - the fourth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fifth node for the V4 stage.\n \nV4 to 5th Trifoliate Leaf (V5) - the fifth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the sixth node for the V5 stage. Trifoliate leaves continue to be produced from a new node until VN which is the last node produced. VN is reached at about R5.5. The first branch may develop in the axil of the first trifoliate around the V5 stage.\n \nThe Reproductive Stages begin when the plants are in the V7 to V10 stages. Many soybean varieties are indeterminate and will continue to produce leaves in the reproductive phase of development.\n \nBeginning Bloom is the first reproductive stage and is known as R1. Flowering begins on the main stem at the third to the sixth node depending on the V stage of the plant. Flowering then proceeds up and down the main stem from the beginning position of flowering. Branches start to flower a few days after the main stem starts to bloom.\n \nR1 to Full Bloom (R2) - the plant is in the V8 to V12 stages.\n \nR2 to Beginning Pod (R3) - pods begin to form on the lower nodes where the first flowers opened. The plant is typically in the V11 to V17 stages.\n \nR3 to Full Pod (R4) - full pod occurs when there is a pod three quarters of an inch long. It is at one of the four uppermost nodes on the main stem with a fully developed leaf. The plant is now in the V13 to V20 stages.\n \nR4 to Beginning Seed (R5) - the seed begins to grow rapidly in this stage with nutrients in the plant being distributed to the seeds. This is the period of seed filling. The plant is in the V15 to V23 stages.\n \nR5 to Full Seed (R6) - the beans or 'green beans' are as wide as the pod cavity. There are, however, beans of all sizes in the pod. The plant is in the V16 to V25 stages. Maximum pod weight on the plant occurs at about R6.\n \nR6 to Beginning Maturity (R7) - beginning maturity is essentially physiological maturity because there will be very little increase in dry weight from now on. The seeds and usually the pod have lost their green color but not all have turned color.\n \nR7 to Full Maturity (R8) - full maturity occurs when 95 percent of the pods have attained their mature pod color.\n \nR8 to Harvest Ready - after Full Maturity, five to ten days of drying weather are needed for the plant to be ready to harvest. The seeds need to have less than 15 percent moisture.\n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays several selections based on maturity. The are four general maturity selections for Soybean varieties including Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity and a number of varieties base on Maturity

Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \n \nThere are eleven growth stages for Spring Wheat and they are identical to those for Winter Wheat but without the overwintering period and the 'Jan 1 to Single Ridge' stage. A description of the growth stages follows:\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first true leaf pushes and then emerges from the tip resulting in emergence.\n \nE to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.\n \nE  to Single Ridge (SR) - Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to Terminal Spikelet (TS) - spikelet primordia continue to be initiated with the terminal spikelet primordium formed just before Jointing.\n \nTS to Jointing (J) - the head is fully formed and can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open. The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.\n \nFLC to Heading (H) -  the head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath resulting in heading.\n \nH to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets. Flowering then progresses up and down the wheat spike.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the \"watery ripe\" and \"milk\" stages. Then the \"soft dough\" phase occurs followed by the \"hard dough\" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels continue to lose moisture throughout grain filling until they reach 30-40% at physiological maturity. The head and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is at maturity.\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.  \n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Spring Wheat varieties in a general sense based on number of leaves. There are five varieties and include 7-Leaved, 8-Leaved which is equivalent to Generic, 9-Leaved, 10-Leaved, and >10-Leaved. There are also three varieties designated by relative time to maturity and include Early Maturity which is equivalent to the 7-Leaved variety, Medium Maturity which is equivalent to Generic, 8-Leaved and 9-Leaved varieties and Late Maturity which is equivalent to the 10-Leaved and >10-Leaved varieties..\n \nThe Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.\n \nThe Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.\n \nLinks to the Phenology Diagram and the Developmental Sequence for Spring Wheat.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Spring_Wheat_Diagrams.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Spring_Wheat_Diagrams.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/sw

Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \n \nThere are eleven growth stages for Spring Barley and they are similar to those for Spring Wheat. However, the 'Double Ridge to Terminal Spikelet' stage of Spring Wheat, is replaced with the 'Double Ridge to Awn Initials Formed' stage in Spring Barley. A description of the growth stages follows:\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first main shoot leaf emerges from the coleoptile.\n \nE to First Tiller - the first tiller occurs when there are about three leaves.\n \nE  to Single Ridge (SR) - the time from emergence to Single Ridge. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develops into spikelet primordia resulting in the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to Awn Initials Formed (AIF) - the awn initials are formed in this stage.\n \nAIF to Jointing (J) -The stem begins to elongate and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.  The head is growing rapidly but is still quite small.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.\n \nFLC to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. This occurs just before or during head emergence from the flag leaf. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets and progresses to the tip and the base of the barley head.\n \nAS to Heading (H) -  the first awns are seen emerging from the collar of the flag leaf indicating heading has begun. The head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath.\n \nH to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the \"watery ripe\" and \"milk\" stages. Then the \"soft dough\" phase occurs followed by the \"hard dough\" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose their green color at the hard dough stage. The kernels continue to lose moisture throughout grain filling until they reach 30-40% at physiological maturity. The glumes and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is mature..\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.  \n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Spring Barley varieties in a general sense based on number of leaves. There are five varieties and include 7-Leaved, 8-Leaved which is equivalent to Generic, 9-Leaved, 10-Leaved, and >10-Leaved. There are also three varieties designated by relative time to maturity and include Early Maturity which is equivalent to the 7-Leaved variety, Medium Maturity which is equivalent to Generic, 8-Leaved and 9-Leaved varieties and Late Maturity which is equivalent to the 10-Leaved and >10-Leaved varieties..\n \nThe Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.\n \nThe Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.\n \n \nLinks to the Phenology Diagram and the Developmental Sequence for Spring Barley.\n \n\n\n","Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Temperatures.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Temperatures.jpg"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#Development_of_the_wheat_plant_chap_2","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#Phytomers_pyllochron_phenology_development","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#Growing_degree-days_two_interpretations","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#Crop_phenology_response_water_stress_phenologyMMS","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"GDD_Methods.htm#GDD_Methods_Figure_-","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/GDD_Methods.htm"},{"origLink":"Set_Inputs.htm#Set_Inputs","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Set_Inputs.htm"},{"origLink":"Output.htm#Output","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Temperatures.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Output.htm"}],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Glossary":["inputs","growing degree-days","GDD","GDD method","Base temperature","Tbase","development","Lower Optimum temperature","Toptlo","growth","Upper Optimum temperature","Toptup","Tupper","Tavg","Tmax","Minimum temperature","Tmin","Topt","tf","run","phyllochron"],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Temperatures","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Temperatures"},{"id":"Phyllochron","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Phyllochron"}],"Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Title":"Temperatures","Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::Keywords":"Temperature, Cardinal, Maximum, Minimum, GDD, Phyllochron, Base, Optimum, Upper,","Path::contents/Temperatures.htm::InnerText":"\nTemperatures\nIt is strongly recommended that the information in this screen not be changed as changing these values will negatively influence the program. They are presented here for information purposes only.\n \nThe ‘Temperatures’ screen presents important temperature and temperature-related input values.\n \n\n \nFour temperature inputs are displayed that are used in calculating the growing degree-days (GDD) for each day as described in each GDD method below:\n \nThe Base temperature (Tbase) is the temperature below which no GDD are accumulated. The assumption is that phenological development does not occur below the base temperature, and therefore no GDD's are accumulated on that day. Tbase is used in all methods of calculating GDD (discussed below).\n \nThe Lower Optimum temperature (Toptlo) is the lower end of the optimum temperature range for growth. This is used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any of the crops in PhenologyMMS 1.4.\n \nThe Upper Optimum temperature (Toptup) is the upper end of the optimum temperature range for growth. This is used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any of the crops in PhenologyMMS 1.4.\n \nThe Upper/Maximum temperature (Tupper) is the highest temperature at which growth can still occur. This is used in Methods 2, 3 and 4 but only Method 2 is implemented for any of the current crops in PhenologyMMS 1.4.\n \nThere are many ways that the GDD required between phenological stages can be calculated. Four commonly used methods are available in PhenologyMMS however, only two methods are currently implemented.  Although these four methods are fairly similar, they have slight variations in approach and the temperature variables used.\n \nWARNING: If you change the temperature values or the GDD Method in the Temperature screen, this will have an adverse effect on the simulation output as the parameter values in the Set Growth Stages screen which are based on the particular Method of calculating GDD for the crop, are NOT adjusted when temperatures or the GDD Method are changed.\n \nThe four GDD METHODS used are described below. For additional information, refer to: McMaster, G. S. 2009; McMaster, G. S. (2005); McMaster, G. S. and W. W. Wilhelm (1997); and McMaster, G. S., et al. (2013).  A diagram of the four GDD Methods is displayed here.\n \nGDD METHOD 1\n \nThis is probably the simplest method of the four. The Average (Tavg) of the Maximum temperature (Tmax) and the Minimum temperature (Tmin) is calculated. The Tbase is then subtracted from the Tavg. If the result is negative then the value is set equal to zero.\n \nMethod 1 is generally used for grasses and here it is applied to Winter Wheat, Spring Wheat, Winter Barley, Spring Barley, Proso Millet and Hay Millet.\n \n \nGDD METHOD 2\nThis is another way of calculating GDD and uses the Upper Temperature (Tupper) threshold for the crop. GDD above the Tupper are not accumulated. Tbase is also used in this Method. Both Tmax and Tmin are compared to Tbase and if Tmax and/or Tmin is less than Tbase then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to the value of Tbase. Likewise, if Tmax and/or Tmin is greater than Tupper, then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to Tupper. The average temperature is calculated and Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. If the resulting value is less than zero, then it is set to zero.\n \nMethod Two is used for Corn, Dry Beans, Sorghum, Soybeans and Sunflower.\n \nGDD METHOD 3\n \nThis method employs a two-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to an Optimum Temperature (Topt), and the second segment extends from Topt to Tupper. The Average temperature is calculated and compared to Tbase and Topt. If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and less than or equal to Topt, then a temperature factor 'tf', which uses the slope of the first segment of the line, is calculated and multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase. This gives the GDD value for the day. However, if the Tavg is greater than Topt and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf', which uses the slope of the second segment of the line, is multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase to give today’s GDD value. If neither comparisons are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then the GDD for the day is zero.\n \nGDD METHOD 4\n \nThis Method uses a three-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo); the second segment from Toptlo to the Upper Optimum Temperature (Toptup); the third segment runs from Toptup to Tupper.\n \nThe Average temperature (Tavg) is calculated and compared to Tbase and the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo). If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and if Tavg is less than Toptlo, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. This value is multiplied by the calculated temperature factor 'tf' which is calculated using the slope of this first segment of the line to get the GDD value for the day. However, if Tavg is greater than or equal to Toptlo and less than or equal to Toptup, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg and that value is multiplied by 'tf' which has been calculated using the slope of the second line segment. This gives the GDD value for the day. If Tavg is greater than Toptup and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf' is calculated using the slope of this third segment of the line and is multiplied by the result of Tavg minus Tbase to yield the GDD value for the day. If none of the situations are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then GDD for the day is set equal to zero.\n \nYou can choose the GDD method with which to run the model however, only Methods 1 and 2 are currently implemented. The default is Method 1. Click on the down arrow to pick one of the other methods.\n \nThe phyllochron, or GDD per leaf, is also entered in this screen in the 'Growing Degree-Days per Leaf:' edit box. This refers to the number of GDD’s required to produce an additional leaf.\n \nThe buttons below the picture are similar to those on the previous screens.\n \nThe ‘Help…’ button - accesses the Help System.\n \nThe ‘Close and Save’ button - closes this screen, returns you to the ‘Set Inputs’ screen and saves the information entered in the ‘Temperatures’ screen.\n \nThe ‘Reset’ button - resets the values back to the original default values.\n \nThe ‘Run…’ button - runs the model and displays output in the Output screen.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"assets/images/sf phenology gdd color NEW.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/sf phenology gdd color NEW.jpg"},{"origLink":"assets/images/sf devseq gdd color NEW.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/sf devseq gdd color NEW.jpg"},{"origLink":"Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm#Sunflower_Growth_Stages","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm"}],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Glossary":["Phenology Diagram","Developmental Sequence"],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Phenology_Diagram","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Phenology_Diagram"},{"id":"Developmental_Sequence","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Developmental_Sequence"}],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Title":"Sunflower Diagrams","Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::Keywords":"Sunflower, Growth Stages, Phenology, Developmental Sequence","Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Developmental Sequence,Phenology Diagram,Sunflower Growth Stages,Sunflower Diagrams","Path::contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm::InnerText":"\nSunflower Diagrams\nPhenology Diagram\n \n\n \n \n \n Developmental Sequence\n \n\n \nLink to: Sunflower Growth Stages\n\n\n","Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#NCDC_weather_data_access","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search#t=secondTabLink","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"relPath":"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search#t=secondTabLink"}],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Glossary":["Weather File","location weather file","run","inputs","Maximum Temperature","Tmax","Minimum Temperature","Tmin","Solar Rad","megajoules","DOY","Day of year","Fahrenheit","Celsius","solar radiation","interpolation"],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Weather_Location_Files","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Weather_Location_Files"}],"Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Title":"Weather/Location Files","Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::Keywords":"Weather, Location, Temperature, Radiation, Precip, Units, Missing Data","Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Weather/Location Files,PhenologyMMS,Days,Tmax,Tmin,DOY,Maximum,Minimum,Weather Files,To convert,MJ,Year,National Climate Data Center,Maximum Temperature,SoilTemp,Precip,Precip:missing,MJ/m,Handle Missing Data,Solar Rad,Solar Radiation,Missing,Missing:Precip,Minimum Temperature,Celsius,Unit Conversions,NOAA,Langley's,I.e.,the,Egajoules,Fahrenheit,Day from Jan,Calendar Year,In day","Path::contents/Weather_Location_Files.htm::InnerText":"\nWeather/Location Files\nA.    The Structure of a Weather File – A location weather file contains data for a specific number of years/days and includes at the least, precipitation and temperature data. PhenologyMMS can run with just these two weather variables. Additional climate inputs may be included in the file, if available.\n1.       Precipitation (precip) – This is the daily precipitation for each day of the weather record. Depending on the location, many days will be 0.0. The units are in mm. 25.4 mm = 1 inch.\n2.       Temperature -\na.    Maximum Temperature (Tmax) – This is the day’s recorded maximum temperature. It is provided in °C.\nb.    Minimum Temperature (Tmin) – This is the day’s recorded minimum temperature. It is provided in °C.\n3.       Solar Radiation (Solar Rad) – This is the light and energy that comes from the sun, i.e. sunlight. The required units for PhenologyMMS are megajoules/meter² (MJ/m²).\n4.       Soil temperature at 5 cm – This is the maximum soil temperature at 5 cm.\n5.       Calendar Year – This is simply the calendar year of the data, e.g., 2004; not the number of the year of the data in the data file at a point in time, i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.\n6.       Day of Year – The day in the year of observation, e.g. 150, that corresponds to the date, May 30, in a non-leap year.\n7.       Additional columns are included in the supplied weather files as these are also used for another model which requires these columns. These are for the day, month and year. This year is not the calendar year; it is the number of the year in the sequence of years within the weather file.\n    \n     B.    How to Add a Weather File.\n1.       Construct the weather file with the following order of data columns:\na. Day – 1 to 28, 29, 30 or 31, whichever is appropriate for the month and year.\nb. Month – 1 to 12\nc. Year – year within the weather file sequence of years; 1, 2, 3, … .\nd. Precip – daily amount of rainfall in mm.\ne. Tmax – Maximum daily temperature in °C.\nf. Tmin – Minimum daily temperature in °C.\ng. Solar Rad – sunlight in MJ/m². MJ = megajoules.\nh. Year – calendar year, e.g., 2004.\ni.  DOY – Day of year, i.e., the sequentially numbered day from Jan. 1 to the day of the date of interest.\nj.  SoilTemp – the day’s maximum soil temperature at 5 cm depth in °C.\n2.       Unit Conversions:\n    a .To convert between units of precipitation:\n                                          i.           1 cm = 10 mm; 1 inch (in) = 25.4 mm\n                                         ii.           cm * 10 = mm; in * 25.4 = mm\n                                        iii.           Trace amount of precip = 0.01 in = 0.254 mm\nb. To convert between Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C):\n                                          i.           °C = (°F – 32) * 5/9\n                                         ii.           °F = (9/5 * °C) + 32\nc. To convert between MJ/m² and Langley’s/day\n                                          i.           1 MJ/m² = 23.895 Langley’s/day\n                                         ii.           Example:  50 MJ/ m² = 50 * 23.895 = 1194.8 Langley’s/day.\n                             350 Langley’s/day = 350/23.895 = 14.6 MJ/m²\nd. Fill the spreadsheet with data. Even though there are columns in the file not needed by PhenologyMMS, they are read in but not used and therefore, these columns must be present in the file.\n3.       How to Handle Missing Data\na. Very often data are missing in the weather record. If the number of consecutive days is not too large, data can be interpolated to fill in missing values for temperature and solar radiation.  Precip is much harder to fill in.\nb. To fill in by interpolation, find the difference between the day before and the day after the missing block of data. Then divide that amount by the number of missing days plus 1. Depending on whether the values are increasing or decreasing as observed from the day before and the day after the missing days, add or subtract the calculated value from the day before the missing block of data. Then using that value add or subtract the calculated value to be added (or subtracted) to/from the previous filled in day and so on throughout the missing block of data. The number of days of missing data that can be filled in by this method should not be a large amount. You may want to determine how many days can be filled in but it should not be larger than 30 days and less is probably better. For larger blocks of data it is better to enter 999.9 for those missing data or try to get data from a nearby weather station.\nc. Precip is a difficult climate variable to estimate because it doesn’t rain daily as temperature always has a daily value. Also, the amount of precip when it does occur can be quite variable.  Generally, we simply enter 999.9 to indicate a missing value.\nd. Another possible way to fill in missing Precip values is to find a weather station close by to the area of interest and fill in with data from that station, if data are available for those dates.\ne. A good source of weather data can be found at the NCDC (National Climate Data Center) at the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) website. http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search#t=secondTabLink . These data are free unless you require them to be certified. (This is usually required when a court has subpoenaed climatic records.) You can select the climate items you want and the period of time for which you want data however, there are often a limited number of climate variables included. Usually, there are more than one climate station and one may be able to piece together a good weather record from one or more stations for the location in question.\n\n\n","Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"Growth_Stages_Example.htm#Growth_Stages_Example","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Growth_Stages_Example.htm"},{"origLink":"assets/images/Sunflower Growth Stages.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Sunflower Growth Stages.jpg"},{"origLink":"References_and_Documents.htm#Sunflower_growth_stages","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/References_and_Documents.htm"},{"origLink":"https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/pdfs/21/6/CS0210060901","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"relPath":"https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/pdfs/21/6/CS0210060901"},{"origLink":"Sunflower_Diagrams.htm#Phenology_Diagram","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm"},{"origLink":"Sunflower_Diagrams.htm#Developmental_Sequence","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Sunflower_Diagrams.htm"}],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Glossary":["Growth Stages","Seeding","Emergence","hypocotyl","leaves","Flower Visible","inflorescence","number of leaves","stem","head","Flower Opens","Anthesis Starts","disk flowers","anthesis","Anthesis Ends","Flower Yellow","Flower Brown","Maturity","physiological maturity","seed","Harvest Ready","Early Maturity","Medium Maturity","Generic","Late Maturity","Oil","Seed sunflowers","Run"],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Sunflower_Growth_Stages","tagName":"a","innerText":"","name":"Sunflower_Growth_Stages"}],"Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Title":"Sunflower Growth Stages","Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::Keywords":"Sunflower, Growth Stages, Emergence, Leaves, Anthesis, Maturity, Harvest Ready, Leaves, Reproductive, Vegetative","Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"Emergence,Emergence:Seeding,Maturity,Maturity:R8,Seeding,Seeding:Emergence,Anthesis Starts,Anthesis Starts:R4,Developmental Sequence,Growth Stages,Phenology Diagram,Harvest Ready,Harvest Ready:R9,PhenologyMMS,Medium Maturity,Internode Elongation Starts,Internode Elongation Starts:R1,Early Maturity,Generic,Late Maturity,R4,R4:Anthesis Starts,Internode Elongation,Internode Elongation:R2,4th Leaf,R5,R5:Anthesis Ends,R3,R3:Flower Opens,8th Leaf,8th Leaf:V4,R2,R2:Internode Elongation,R1,R1:Internode Elongation Starts,Flower Opens,Flower Opens:R3,Flower Brown,Flower Brown:R7,12th Leaf,12th Leaf:V8,Helianthus,V12,V12:Flower Visible,R9,R9:Harvest Ready,Flower Yellow,Flower Yellow:R6,V4,V4:8th Leaf,Sunflower,Flower Visible,Flower Visible:V12,Anthesis Ends,Anthesis Ends:R5,Growth Stages Example,Oil,V8,V8:12th Leaf,Sunflower Growth Stages,R8,R8:Maturity,R6,R6:Flower Yellow,R7,R7:Flower Brown","Path::contents/Sunflower_Growth_Stages.htm::InnerText":"\nSunflower Growth Stages\nThe Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)

The first true leaf blade is present but not yet long enough to be counted as a leaf. A leaf blade is considered to be a true leaf when it has attained a length of 4 cm.\n \nE to 4th Leaf (V4) - four leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.\n \nV4 to 8th Leaf (V8) - eight leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.\n \nV8 to 12th Leaf (V12) - twelve leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.\n \nV12 to Flower Visible (R1) - the inflorescence becomes visible. It is surrounded by immature bracts which when viewed from above have a star-like appearance. The appearance of R1 can vary among genotypes with respect to the number of leaves already produced.\n \nR1 to Internode Elongation Starts  (R2) - the internode below the base of the inflorescence and above the nearest leaf that is attached to the stem, begins to elongate but is less than 2 cm.\n \nR2 to Internode Elongation > 2 cm (R3) - the internode below the base of the developing head continues to elongate and is now greater than 2 cm. It pushes the inflorescence above the surrounding leaves.\n \nR3 to Flower Opens (R4) - the inflorescence begins to open making small ray flowers visible.\n \nR4 to Anthesis Starts (R5) - the ray flowers are mature and fully extended. All the disk flowers are visible. This stage can be divided into substages depending on how many of the disk flowers are in or have completed anthesis.\n \nR5 to Anthesis Ends (R6) - at this stage, anthesis is finished and the ray flowers are wilting. The ray flowers vary as to whether they wilt and abscise immediately or not.\n \nR6 to Flower Yellow (R7) - the back of the head begins to turn a light yellow beginning at the center of the head or it may start at the edge of the head adjacent to the bracts.\n \nR7 to Flower Brown (R8) - the back of the head is yellow but may contain some brown spots. The bracts are still green.\n \nR8 to Maturity (R9) - the bracts are turning yellow and brown. Much of the back of the head may become brown. This is physiological maturity and seed moisture is about 35%.\n \nR9 to Harvest Ready - the plant is ready for harvest when the seeds are at 14 - 15 % moisture.

Many of the cereal grasses follow this pattern of growth.\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first true leaf pushes and then emerges from the tip resulting in emergence.\n \nE to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.\n \nJan 1 to Single Ridge (SR) - Jan. 1 is an accepted date in the Northern hemisphere from which to begin accumulation of growing degree-days for the growth of the crop. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to Terminal Spikelet (TS) - spikelet primordia continue to be initiated until the last or terminal spikelet primordium is formed just before Jointing.\n \nTS to Jointing (J) - the head is fully formed and can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open. The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.\n \nFLC to Heading (H) -  the head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath resulting in heading.\n \nH to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets. Flowering then progresses up and down the wheat spike.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the \"watery ripe\" and \"milk\" stages. Then the \"soft dough\" phase occurs followed by the \"hard dough\" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose moisture throughout grain filling and are between 30-40% at physiological maturity. The head and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is at maturity.\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.  \n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays four available selections of Winter Wheat varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity including Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity.

Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \nFourteen different growth stages are given for a corn plant. A plant is determined to be at a specific growth stage when 50% of the plants in the field have reached the stage under consideration. They are listed here and include:\n \nSeeding (S) to Emergence (E) – the seedling emerges from the soil.\n \nVegetative growth:\nE to 4th Leaf (V4) – emergence of the seedling has occurred and four leaves are present each with a visible leaf collar. This is one of the vegetative stages.\n \nV4 to Tassel Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when tassels are initiated.\n \nV4 to Ear Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when ears are initiated. Ear Initiation, tassel initiation, tiller initiation and internode elongation starts all occur at approximately the same time.\n \nV4 to Internode Elongation Begins – the vegetative stage continues to when the internodes between leaves begin to elongate. That is, the stem begins to lengthen. This also, occurs at about the same time as the two previous stages plus tiller initiation.\n \nV4 to 12th Leaf (V12) – vegetative growth continues resulting in 12 leaves with visible leaf collars. This too, occurs at approximately the same time as the three previous stages plus tiller initiation.\n \nV12 to Tasseling – tassels are visible at this stage.\n \nGrain filling:\nThe following reference was very helpful in describing the reproductive stages: 'R. L. ‘Bob’ Nielsen. Updated August, 2013. Grain fill stages in corn. URL: https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/GrainFill.html  Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.'.\n \nV12 to Silking (R1) – this occurs at about the same time as tasseling and indicates a shift in the plant from vegetative growth to reproductive stages. The silks are the functional stigma of the female flower and develop from the ovules. Pollen grains are released by the male flowers and when captured by the silks, germinate and develop pollen tubes that penetrate the silk tissue. The germinated pollen grains or male gametes travel down the pollen tube and fertilize the ovule. The ovules closest to the base of the ear develop silks first and silking proceeds up the ear to the tip.\n \nR1 to Blister (R2) – this is the second reproductive stage and the kernels appear as whitish blisters on the cob. They contain much clear fluid and some starch.\n \nR2 to Milk (R3) – by this stage the kernels contain a milky white fluid and the kernels are mostly yellow. Starch continues to accumulate.\n \nR3 to Dough (R4) – the kernel’s fluid is a soft dough due to starch accumulation which continues in this stage. The kernels now have about 50% of their mature dry weight.\n \nR4 to Dent (R5) – the kernels show a dent in the crown. There is also a milk line which is the boundary between the milk and starch layers. The milk line is near the dent end of the kernel  and progresses to the tip end of the kernel over approximately three weeks.\n \nR5 to Maturity R6) – at this stage the kernels are at their maximum dry weight and are considered to be physiologically mature. This occurs just after the milk line disappears and just before the black layer forms at the tip of the kernel.\n \nR6 to Harvest Ready – the kernels are ready for harvest when their moisture content has decreased to near 25%.

Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to Awn Initials Formed (AIF) - the awn initials are formed in this stage.\n \nAIF to Jointing (J) -The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.  The head is growing rapidly but is still quite small.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the prominent head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.\n \nFLC to Heading (H) -  when the first awns are seen emerging from the collar of the flag leaf, heading has begun. The head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath.\n \nH to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets and progresses to the tip and the base of the barley head.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the \"watery ripe\" and \"milk\" stages. Then the \"soft dough\" phase occurs followed by the \"hard dough\" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose their green color at the hard dough stage. The kernels lose moisture throughout grain filling and are between 30-40% at physiological maturity. The glumes and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is mature.\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.  \n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Winter Barley varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity. There are four varieties and include Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity.\n \nThe Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been

Moench) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Medium variety which is analogous to the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \nSorghum has eleven growth stages depicted in PhenologyMMS which follow those of winter wheat with a few differences.\n \nA more generalized view of sorghum divides its growth into three stages. The first stage (GS I) is when vegetative growth occurs, the second stage (GS II) is when the reproductive structures are formed and the third stage (GS III) is devoted to grain ripening.\n \nA description of the stages in PhenologyMMS follows:\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the young seedling pushes through to the soil surface making the coleoptile visible.\n \nE to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges and occurs at the four and six-leaf stage.\n \nE to Growing Point Differentiation (GPD) - the growing point differentiates or changes from producing leaves to producing reproductive structures, i.e., the head.\n \nE to Internode Elongation Starts (IES) - the internode begins to elongate.\n \nIES to Jointing (J) - jointing occurs when the first node is present. However, this is not externally visible in sorghum.\n \nGPD to End of Leaf Growth (ELG) - the end of leaf growth occurs when the flag leaf has emerged from the whorl, the collar of the flag leaf is visible and all leaves are fully expanded. The head is nearly full size and is enclosed in the sheath of the flag leaf. The plant is now in the boot stage.\n \nELG to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the peduncle pushes the panicle from the flag leaf sheath. Heading has occurred when 50% of the plants have a visible panicle. Flowering or anthesis starts or first bloom starts from the tip of the head and progresses down the panicle.\n \nFirst Bloom AS to Half Bloom (HB) - the head is considered to be at half bloom when flowering has progressed halfway down the panicle; the field is at half-bloom when 50% of the plants in the field are at some stage of bloom.\n \nHB to Full Bloom (FB) - the heads of the plants are fully bloomed.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - this stage covers the beginning of flowering through the development of the kernels into mature grain. This encompasses the milk, soft dough and hard dough stages of the kernel.

Err.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n \n\n \nThere are sixteen growth stages for Soybean. The descriptions of the growth stages below came from this University of Wisconsin reference for Soybean.\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs .The primary root grows downward and the hypocotyl emerges from the soil pulling the two cotyledons with it. The cotyledons are unifoliate leaves. This is also known as VE.\n \nE to Cotyledonary Leaves - the hypocotyl straightens out and the cotyledons unfold and expand. This is the beginning of the VC stage and the vegetative phase.\n \nVC to 1st Trifoliate Leaf (V1) - the first set of two Trifoliate leaves appear. They originate from the second node. The first node was the unifoliolate node.\n \nV1 to 2nd Trifoliate Leaf (V2) - the second set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the third node creating the V2 stage.\n \nV2 to 3rd Trifoliate Leaf (V3) - the third set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fourth node for the V3 stage.\n \nV4 to 4th Trifoliate Leaf (V4) - the fourth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fifth node for the V4 stage.\n \nV4 to 5th Trifoliate Leaf (V5) - the fifth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the sixth node for the V5 stage. Trifoliate leaves continue to be produced from a new node until VN which is the last node produced. VN is reached at about R5.5. The first branch may develop in the axil of the first trifoliate around the V5 stage.\n \nThe Reproductive Stages begin when the plants are in the V7 to V10 stages. Many soybean varieties are indeterminate and will continue to produce leaves in the reproductive phase of development.\n \nBeginning Bloom is the first reproductive stage and is known as R1. Flowering begins on the main stem at the third to the sixth node depending on the V stage of the plant. Flowering then proceeds up and down the main stem from the beginning position of flowering. Branches start to flower a few days after the main stem starts to bloom.\n \nR1 to Full Bloom (R2) - the plant is in the V8 to V12 stages.\n \nR2 to Beginning Pod (R3) - pods begin to form on the lower nodes where the first flowers opened. The plant is typically in the V11 to V17 stages.\n \nR3 to Full Pod (R4) - full pod occurs when there is a pod three quarters of an inch long. It is at one of the four uppermost nodes on the main stem with a fully developed leaf. The plant is now in the V13 to V20 stages.\n \nR4 to Beginning Seed (R5) - the seed begins to grow rapidly in this stage with nutrients in the plant being distributed to the seeds. This is the period of seed filling. The plant is in the V15 to V23 stages.\n \nR5 to Full Seed (R6) - the beans or 'green beans' are as wide as the pod cavity. There are however, beans of all sizes in the pod. The plant is in the V16 to V25 stages. Maximum pod weight on the plant occurs at about R6.\n \nR6 to Beginning Maturity (R7) - beginning maturity is essentially physiological maturity because there will be very little increase in dry weight from now on. The seeds and usually the pod have lost their green color but not all have turned color.\n \nR7 to Full Maturity (R8) - full maturity occurs when 95 percent of the pods have attained their mature pod color.\n \nR8 to Harvest Ready - after Full Maturity, five to ten days of drying weather are needed for the plant to be ready to harvest. The seeds need to have less than 15 percent moisture.\n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays several selections based on maturity.

Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.\n \n\n \nThere are eleven growth stages for Winter Barley and they are similar to those for Winter Wheat. However, the 'Double Ridge to Terminal Spikelet' stage of Winter Wheat, is replaced with the 'Double Ridge to Awn Initials Formed' stage for Winter Barley. A description of the growth stages follows:\n \nSeeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first main shoot leaf emerges from the coleoptile.\n \nE to First Tiller - the time from emergence to the first tiller.\n \nJan 1 to Single Ridge (SR) - Jan. 1 is an accepted date in the Northern hemisphere from which to begin accumulation of growing degree-days for the growth of the crop. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.\n \nSR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.\n \nDR to Awn Initials Formed (AIF) - the awn initials are formed in this stage.\n \nAIF to Jointing (J) -The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.  The head is growing rapidly but is still quite small.\n \nJ to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the prominent head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.\n \nFLC to Heading (H) -  when the first awns are seen emerging from the collar of the flag leaf, heading has begun. The head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath.\n \nH to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. This occurs just before or during head emergence from the flag leaf. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets and progresses to the tip and the base of the barley head.\n \nAS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the \"watery ripe\" and \"milk\" stages. Then the \"soft dough\" phase occurs followed by the \"hard dough\" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose their green color at the hard dough stage. The kernels lose moisture throughout grain filling and are between 30-40% at physiological maturity. The glumes and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is mature.\n \nM to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.  \n \n \nThe Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .\n \nThe Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.\n \nThe Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Winter Barley varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity.

Ecological Modelling 68:183-203). Four soil water levels are available and the user inputs the condition of the soil at planting time. The GDD required for germination increases and the elongation rate decreases as water content decreases. After planting, precipitation can shift the soil moisture condition upwards toward Optimum but there is no provision reducing the soil moisture level due to evaporation.\n \nThe four soil moisture levels are: Optimum, Medium, Dry and Planted in Dust. These are shown for Winter Wheat in Table 1 below which is found in Table 2 in the reference cited above. Other input parameters include the lower and upper Water-filled pore space (wfpslo and wfpsup), Germination time (germgdd), and Elongation rate (ergdd).\n \nDaily precipitation is read in from the weather file and is given in mm.\n \nSeeds planted in soil water conditions considered to be ‘Planted in Dust’ are assumed to not begin the germination process until some minimal soil water level is reached (i.e., 'Dry' conditions). Therefore, seeds Planted in Dust must move up to the Dry soil moisture level before beginning the accumulation of thermal time required for germination. At least seven mm or more of precipitation must be received before soil moisture can move from Planted in Dust to Dry conditions.\n \nIn order to provide a more realistic process of germination, two intermediate soil moisture levels were added. These occur between Optimum and Medium and between Medium and Dry. These were necessary because germination was occurring too rapidly with only the four soil moisture conditions named above.\n \nOnce germination has occurred, the elongation rate of the coleoptile (ergdd) is increased based on the input elongation rate in mm per growing degree-day for the soil moisture condition. This value is multiplied by the day’s growing degree-day value and added to the elongation amount already achieved. Once the elongation length is greater than the planting depth, emergence has occurred.\n \nTABLE 1  (from Table 2 in the Ref. cited above)\n \nSeed germination and seedling elongation rates for several broad categories of seedbed conditions.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeedbed condition\n\n\nWater-filled pore space (%)\n\n\nGermination time (GDDa)\n\n\nElongation rate (mm GDD-1)\n\n\n\n\nOptimum\n\n\n> 45\n\n\n80\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n\n\nBarely adequate\n\n\n35-45\n\n\n90\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n\n\nDry\n\n\n25-35\n\n\n110\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n\n\nPlanted in Dust\n\n\n<25\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n \n \naGDD = growing degree-day (base 0°C) Wheat\n \n\n\n \n \n \nLinks to: GDD Methods\n               Temperatures\n               Weather/Location Files\n\n\n","Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::Links":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::Variables":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::Conditions":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::TopicConditions":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::Glossary":[],"Path::index/PhenologyMMS 1.idx::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/css/Setup/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/Setup/default.css"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Setup/Set Inputs 1.3 Wheat.gif","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Setup/Set Inputs 1.3 Wheat.gif"}],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Glossary":["Optimum","Medium","Dry","Planted In Dust","emergence","Planting Depth","seedling","Planting Rate","Latitude","photoperiod","Canopy Height","Run"],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Author":"Debbie Edmunds","Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Title":"Set Inputs","Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::Keywords":"Inputs, Planting Date, Soil Moisture, Depth, Rate, Lattitude, Canopy Height, Temperature","Path::contents/Setup/Set_Inputs.htm::InnerText":"\nSet Inputs\nThe Set Inputs Screen contains basic planting information.

PhenologyMMS can run with just these two weather variables. Additional climate inputs may be included in the file, if available.\n1.       Precipitation (precip) – This is the daily precipitation for each day of the weather record. Depending on the location, many days will be 0.0. The units are in mm. 25.4 mm = 1 inch.\n2.       Temperature -\na.    Maximum Temperature (Tmax) – This is the day’s recorded maximum temperature. It is provided in °C.\nb.    Minimum Temperature (Tmin) – This is the day’s recorded minimum temperature. It is provided in °C.\n3.       Solar Radiation (Solar Rad) – This is the light and energy that comes from the sun, i.e. sunlight. The required units for PhenologyMMS are megajoules/meter² (MJ/m²).\n4.       Soil temperature at 5 cm – This is the maximum soil temperature at 5 cm.\n5.       Calendar Year – This is simply the calendar year of the data, e.g., 2004; not the number of the year of the data in the data file at a point in time, i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.\n6.       Day of Year – The day in the year of observation, e.g. 150, that corresponds to the date, May 30, in a non-leap year.\n7.       Additional columns are included in the supplied weather files as these are also used for another model which requires these columns. These are for the day, month and year. This year is not the  calendar year; it is the number of the year in the sequence of years within the weather file.\n    \n     B.    How to Add a Weather File.\n1.       Construct the weather file with the following order of data columns:\na. Day – 1 to 28, 29, 30 or 31, whichever is appropriate for the month and year.\nb. Month – 1 to 12\nc. Year – year within the weather file sequence of years; 1, 2, 3, … .\nd. Precip – daily amount of rainfall in mm.\ne. Tmax – Maximum daily temperature in °C.\nf. Tmin – Minimum daily temperature in °C.\ng. Solar Rad – sunlight in MJ/m². MJ = megajoules.\nh. Year – calendar year, e.g., 2004.\ni.  DOY – Day of year, i.e., the sequentially numbered day from Jan. 1 to the day of the date of interest.\nj.  SoilTemp – the day’s maximum soil temperature at 5 cm depth in °C.\n2.       Unit Conversions:\n    a .To convert between units of precipitation:\n                                          i.           1 cm = 10 mm; 1 inch (in) = 25.4 mm\n                                         ii.           cm * 10 = mm; in * 25.4 = mm\n                                        iii.           Trace amount of precip = 0.01 in = 0.254 mm\nb. To convert between Fahrenheit (°F) and Celsius (°C):\n                                          i.           °C = (°F – 32) * 5/9\n                                         ii.           °F = (9/5 * °C) + 32\nc. To convert between MJ/m² and Langley’s/day\n                                          i.           1 MJ/m² = 23.895 Langley’s/day\n                                         ii.           Example:  50 MJ/ m² = 50 * 23.895 = 1194.8 Langley’s/day.\n                             350 Langley’s/day = 350/23.895 = 14.6 MJ/m²\nd. Fill the spreadsheet with data. Even though there are columns in the file not needed by PhenologyMMS, they are read in but not used and therefore, these columns must be present in the file.\n3.       How to Handle Missing Data\na. Very often data are missing in the weather record. If the number of consecutive days is not too large, data can be interpolated to fill in data that are missing for temperature and solar radiation.  Precip is much harder to fill in.\nb. To fill in by interpolation find the difference between the day before and the day after the missing block of data. Then divide that amount by the number of missing days plus 1. Depending on whether the values are increasing or decreasing as observed from the day before and the day after the missing days, add or subtract the calculated value from the day before the missing block of data. Then using that value add or subtract the calculated value to be added (or subtracted) to/from the previous filled in day and so on throughout the missing block of data. The number of days of missing data that can be filled in by this method should not be a large amount. You may want to determine how many days can be filled in but it should not be larger than 30 days and less is probably better. For larger blocks of data it is better to enter 999.9 for those missing data or try to get data from a nearby weather station.\nc. Precip is a difficult climate variable to estimate because it doesn’t rain daily as temperature always has a daily value. Also, the amount of precip when it does occur can be quite variable.  Generally, we simply enter 999.9 to indicate a missing value.\nd. Another possible way to fill in missing Precip values is to find a weather station close by to the area of interest and fill in with data from that station, if data are available for those dates.\ne. A good source of weather data can be found at the NCDC (National Climate Data Center) at the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) website. http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search#t=secondTabLink . These data are free unless you require them to be certified. (This is usually required when a court has subpoenaed climatic records.) You can select the climate items you want and the period of time for which you want data however, there are often a limited number of climate variables included. Usually, there are more than one climate station and one may be able to piece together a good weather record from one or more stations for the location in question.\n\n\n","Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::Links":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::Variables":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::Conditions":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::TopicConditions":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::Glossary":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/BSSCDefault.ali::Bookmarks":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::Links":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::Variables":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::Conditions":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::TopicConditions":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::Glossary":[],"Path::publish/mapfiles/PhenologyMMS14.ali::Bookmarks":[],"Path::publish/presets/Printed

negatively influence the program. They are presented here for information purposes only.\n \nThe ‘Temperatures’ screen presents important temperature and temperature-related input values.\n \n\nFour temperature inputs are displayed that are used in calculating the growing degree-days (GDD) for each day as described in each GDD method below:\n \nThe Base temperature (Tbase) is the temperature below which no GDD are accumulated. The assumption is that phenological development does not occur below the base temperature, and therefore no GDD's are accumulated on that day. Tbase is used in all methods of calculating GDD (discussed below).\n \nThe Lower Optimum temperature (Toptlo) is the lower end of the optimum temperature range for growth. This is used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any of the crops in PhenologyMMS 1.3.\n \nThe Upper Optimum temperature (Toptup) is the upper end of the optimum temperature range for growth. This is used only in Method 4 and currently is not implemented for any of the crops in PhenologyMMS 1.3.\n \nThe Upper/Maximum temperature (Tupper) is the highest temperature at which growth can still occur. This is used in Methods 2, 3 and 4 but only Method 2 is implemented for any of the current crops in PhenologyMMS 1.3.\n \nThere are many ways that the GDD required between phenological stages can be calculated. Four commonly used methods are available in PhenologyMMS however, only two methods are currently implemented.  Although these four methods are fairly similar, they have slight variations in approach and the temperature variables used.\n \nWARNING: If you change the temperature values or the GDD Method in the Temperature screen, this will have an adverse effect on the simulation output as the parameter values in the Set Growth Stages screen which are based on the particular Method of calculating GDD for the crop, are NOT adjusted when temperatures or the GDD Method are changed.\n \nThe four GDD METHODS used are described below. For additional information, refer to: McMaster, G. S. 2009; McMaster, G. S. (2005); McMaster, G. S. and W. W. Wilhelm (1997); and McMaster, G. S., et al. (2013).  A diagram of the four GDD Methods is displayed here.\n \nGDD METHOD 1\n \nThis is probably the simplest method of the four. The Average (Tavg) of the Maximum temperature (Tmax) and the Minimum temperature (Tmin) is calculated. The Tbase is then subtracted from the Tavg. If the result is negative then the value is set equal to zero.\n \nMethod 1 is generally used for grasses and here it is applied to Winter Wheat, Spring Wheat, Winter Barley, Spring Barley, Proso Millet and Hay Millet.\n \n \nGDD METHOD 2\nThis is another way of calculating GDD and uses the Upper Temperature (Tupper) threshold for the crop. GDD above the Tupper are not accumulated. Tbase is also used in this Method. Both Tmax and Tmin are compared to Tbase and if Tmax and/or Tmin is less than Tbase then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to the value of Tbase. Likewise, if Tmax and/or Tmin is greater than Tupper, then Tmax and/or Tmin is set equal to Tupper. The average temperature is calculated and Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. If the resulting value is less than zero, then it is set to zero.\n \nMethod Two is used for Corn, Dry Beans, Sorghum, Soybeans and Sunflower.\n \nGDD METHOD 3\n \nThis method employs a two-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to an Optimum Temperature (Topt), and the second segment extends from Topt to Tupper. The Average temperature is calculated and compared to Tbase and Topt. If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and less than or equal to Topt, then a temperature factor 'tf', which uses the slope of the first segment of the line, is calculated and multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase. This gives the GDD value for the day. However, if the Tavg is greater than Topt and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf', which uses the slope of the second segment of the line, is multiplied by the value of Tavg minus Tbase to give today’s GDD value. If neither comparisons are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then the GDD for the day is zero.\n \nGDD METHOD 4\n \nThis Method uses a three-segmented linear model. The first segment extends from Tbase to the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo); the second segment from Toptlo to the Upper Optimum Temperature (Toptup); the third segment runs from Toptup to Tupper.\n \nThe Average temperature (Tavg) is calculated and compared to Tbase and the Lower Optimum Temperature (Toptlo). If Tavg is greater than or equal to Tbase and if Tavg is less than Toptlo, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg. This value is multiplied by the calculated temperature factor 'tf' which is calculated using the slope of this first segment of the line to get the GDD value for the day. However, if Tavg is greater than or equal to Toptlo and less than or equal to Toptup, then Tbase is subtracted from Tavg and that value is multiplied by 'tf' which has been calculated using the slope of the second line segment. This gives the GDD value for the day. If Tavg is greater than Toptup and less than or equal to Tupper, then 'tf' is calculated using the slope of this third segment of the line and is multiplied by the result of Tavg minus Tbase to yield the GDD value for the day. If none of the situations are true and Tavg is less than Tbase or greater than Tupper, then GDD for the day is set equal to zero.\n \nYou can choose the GDD method with which to run the model however, only Methods 1 and 2 are currently implemented. The default is Method 1. Click on the down arrow to pick one of the other methods.\n \nThe phyllochron, or GDD per leaf, is also entered in this screen in the 'Growing Degree-Days per Leaf:' edit box. This refers to the number of GDD’s required to produce an additional leaf.\n \nThe buttons below the picture are similar to those on the previous screens.\n \nThe ‘Help…’ button - accesses the Help System.\n \nThe ‘Close and Save’ button - closes this screen, returns you to the ‘Set Inputs’ screen and saves the information entered in the ‘Temperatures’ screen.\n \nThe ‘Reset’ button - resets the values back to the original default values.\n \nThe ‘Run…’ button - runs the model and displays output in the Output screen.\n\n\n","Path::publish/presets/Microsoft HTML
