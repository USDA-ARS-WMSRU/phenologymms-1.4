Hay Millet Growth Stages
The Hay Millet Growth Stages screen is displayed below showing the parameters for the Generic Variety.  Hay Millet is also known as Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.) . Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 
 

 
 
Hay Millet has eleven growth stages which follow those of winter wheat with small differences. A description of each stage follows.
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the young seedling pushes through the soil to the soil surface.
 
E to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.
 
E to Single Ridge (SR) - single ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.
 
SR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordium resulting in the double ridge stage.
 
DR to End Spikelet Initiation (ESI) - spikelet primordium continue to be initiated until the end of spikelet initiation.
 
ESI to Jointing (J) - jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot. The developing head can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open.
 
J to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.
 
FLC to Heading (H) - when the hay millet head is visible in the leaf sheath of the flag leaf, booting has occurred. When the head emerges from the leaf sheath, heading has occurred.
 
H to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower. Anthers are visible at this stage and pollination is occurring.
 
AS to Maturity (M) - pollination progresses until complete and the kernels ripen and progress from being watery ripe to milky ripe to dough to hardening.
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernels are sufficiently hard and at the proper moisture content so harvest can commence.

The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Hay Millet varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity. There are four varieties and include Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
