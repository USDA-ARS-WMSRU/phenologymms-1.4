Winter Wheat Growth Stages
The Winter Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
 
There are eleven growth stages for winter wheat. Many of the cereal grasses follow this pattern of growth.
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first true leaf pushes and then emerges from the tip resulting in emergence.
 
E to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.
 
Jan 1 to Single Ridge (SR) - Jan. 1 is an accepted date in the Northern hemisphere from which to begin accumulation of growing degree-days for the growth of the crop. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.
 
SR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.
 
DR to Terminal Spikelet (TS) - spikelet primordia continue to be initiated until the last or terminal spikelet primordium is formed just before Jointing.
 
TS to Jointing (J) - the head is fully formed and can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open. The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.
 
J to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.
 
FLC to Heading (H) -  the head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath resulting in heading.
 
H to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets. Flowering then progresses up and down the wheat spike.
 
AS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the "watery ripe" and "milk" stages. Then the "soft dough" phase occurs followed by the "hard dough" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose moisture throughout grain filling and are between 30-40% at physiological maturity. The head and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is at maturity.
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.

The Variety drop down list displays four available selections of Winter Wheat varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity including Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity. Several named varieties follow in the list with designations following the name which refer to whether they are hard red winter (HRW) or hard white winter (HWW) types followed by maturity designations including Early Maturity (EM), Medium Maturity (MM), and Late Maturity (LM). An additional designation refers to the plant height with Short (S), Medium (M) and Tall (T) being the choices. Following these varieties are several older named varieties which do not have the previous designations.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
