Sorghum Growth Stages
The Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Medium variety which is analogous to the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
Sorghum has eleven growth stages depicted in PhenologyMMS which follow those of winter wheat with a few differences.
 
A more generalized view of sorghum divides its growth into three stages. The first stage (GS I) is when vegetative growth occurs, the second stage (GS II) is when the reproductive structures are formed and the third stage (GS III) is devoted to grain ripening.
 
A description of the stages in PhenologyMMS follows:
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the young seedling pushes through to the soil surface making the coleoptile visible.
 
E to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges and occurs at the four and six-leaf stage.
 
E to Growing Point Differentiation (GPD) - the growing point differentiates or changes from producing leaves to producing reproductive structures, i.e., the head.
 
E to Internode Elongation Starts (IES) - the internode begins to elongate.
 
IES to Jointing (J) - jointing occurs when the first node is present. However, this is not externally visible in sorghum.
 
GPD to End of Leaf Growth (ELG) - the end of leaf growth occurs when the flag leaf has emerged from the whorl, the collar of the flag leaf is visible and all leaves are fully expanded. The head is nearly full size and is enclosed in the sheath of the flag leaf. The plant is now in the boot stage.
 
ELG to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the peduncle pushes the panicle from the flag leaf sheath. Heading has occurred when 50% of the plants have a visible panicle. Flowering or anthesis starts or first bloom starts from the tip of the head and progresses down the panicle.
 
First Bloom AS to Half Bloom (HB) - the head is considered to be at half bloom when flowering has progressed halfway down the panicle; the field is at half-bloom when 50% of the plants in the field are at some stage of bloom.
 
HB to Full Bloom (FB) - the heads of the plants are fully bloomed.
 
AS to Maturity (M) - this stage covers the beginning of flowering through the development of the kernels into mature grain. This encompasses the milk, soft dough and hard dough stages of the kernel. The grain is physiologically mature when the black layer appears above the point where the kernel was attached in the florets near the kernel base.
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernel needs to dry down before reaching harvest ready. When the moisture content is 20%, the grain can be harvested but it is better to dry to 14% to safely store the grain in bins when drying equipment is not available.

The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.
 
The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Sorghum varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity. There are four varieties and include Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
