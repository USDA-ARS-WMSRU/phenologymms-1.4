Soybean Growth Stages
The Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Err.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 
 

 
There are sixteen growth stages for Soybean. The descriptions of the growth stages below came from this University of Wisconsin reference for Soybean.
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs .The primary root grows downward and the hypocotyl emerges from the soil pulling the two cotyledons with it. The cotyledons are unifoliate leaves. This is also known as VE.
 
E to Cotyledonary Leaves - the hypocotyl straightens out and the cotyledons unfold and expand. This is the beginning of the VC stage and the vegetative phase.
 
VC to 1st Trifoliate Leaf (V1) - the first set of two Trifoliate leaves appear. They originate from the second node. The first node was the unifoliolate node.
 
V1 to 2nd Trifoliate Leaf (V2) - the second set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the third node creating the V2 stage.
 
V2 to 3rd Trifoliate Leaf (V3) - the third set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fourth node for the V3 stage.
 
V4 to 4th Trifoliate Leaf (V4) - the fourth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the fifth node for the V4 stage.
 
V4 to 5th Trifoliate Leaf (V5) - the fifth set of Trifoliate leaves appear from the sixth node for the V5 stage. Trifoliate leaves continue to be produced from a new node until VN which is the last node produced. VN is reached at about R5.5. The first branch may develop in the axil of the first trifoliate around the V5 stage.
 
The Reproductive Stages begin when the plants are in the V7 to V10 stages. Many soybean varieties are indeterminate and will continue to produce leaves in the reproductive phase of development.
 
Beginning Bloom is the first reproductive stage and is known as R1. Flowering begins on the main stem at the third to the sixth node depending on the V stage of the plant. Flowering then proceeds up and down the main stem from the beginning position of flowering. Branches start to flower a few days after the main stem starts to bloom.
 
R1 to Full Bloom (R2) - the plant is in the V8 to V12 stages.
 
R2 to Beginning Pod (R3) - pods begin to form on the lower nodes where the first flowers opened. The plant is typically in the V11 to V17 stages.
 
R3 to Full Pod (R4) - full pod occurs when there is a pod three quarters of an inch long. It is at one of the four uppermost nodes on the main stem with a fully developed leaf. The plant is now in the V13 to V20 stages.
 
R4 to Beginning Seed (R5) - the seed begins to grow rapidly in this stage with nutrients in the plant being distributed to the seeds. This is the period of seed filling. The plant is in the V15 to V23 stages.
 
R5 to Full Seed (R6) - the beans or 'green beans' are as wide as the pod cavity. There are however, beans of all sizes in the pod. The plant is in the V16 to V25 stages. Maximum pod weight on the plant occurs at about R6.
 
R6 to Beginning Maturity (R7) - beginning maturity is essentially physiological maturity because there will be very little increase in dry weight from now on. The seeds and usually the pod have lost their green color but not all have turned color.
 
R7 to Full Maturity (R8) - full maturity occurs when 95 percent of the pods have attained their mature pod color.
 
R8 to Harvest Ready - after Full Maturity, five to ten days of drying weather are needed for the plant to be ready to harvest. The seeds need to have less than 15 percent moisture.

The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.
 
The Variety drop down list displays several selections based on maturity. The are four general maturity selections for Soybean varieties including Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity and a number of varieties base on Maturity Group ranging from MG 000.5 to MG 10.5. in .5 increments.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
