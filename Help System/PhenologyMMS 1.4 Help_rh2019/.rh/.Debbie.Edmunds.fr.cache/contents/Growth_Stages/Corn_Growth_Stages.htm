Corn Growth Stages
The Growth Stages screen for Corn (Zea mays L.)  is displayed below. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
Fourteen different growth stages are given for a corn plant. A plant is determined to be at a specific growth stage when 50% of the plants in the field have reached the stage under consideration. They are listed here and include:
 
Seeding (S) to Emergence (E) – the seedling emerges from the soil.
 
Vegetative growth:
E to 4th Leaf (V4) – emergence of the seedling has occurred and four leaves are present each with a visible leaf collar. This is one of the vegetative stages.
 
V4 to Tassel Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when tassels are initiated.
 
V4 to Ear Initiation – the vegetative stage continues to when ears are initiated. Ear Initiation, tassel initiation, tiller initiation and internode elongation starts all occur at approximately the same time.
 
V4 to Internode Elongation Begins – the vegetative stage continues to when the internodes between leaves begin to elongate. That is, the stem begins to lengthen. This also, occurs at about the same time as the two previous stages plus tiller initiation.
 
V4 to 12th Leaf (V12) – vegetative growth continues resulting in 12 leaves with visible leaf collars. This too, occurs at approximately the same time as the three previous stages plus tiller initiation.
 
V12 to Tasseling – tassels are visible at this stage.
 
Grain filling:
The following reference was very helpful in describing the reproductive stages: 'R. L. ‘Bob’ Nielsen. Updated August, 2013. Grain fill stages in corn. URL: https://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/GrainFill.html  Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.'.
 
V12 to Silking (R1) – this occurs at about the same time as tasseling and indicates a shift in the plant from vegetative growth to reproductive stages. The silks are the functional stigma of the female flower and develop from the ovules. Pollen grains are released by the male flowers and when captured by the silks, germinate and develop pollen tubes that penetrate the silk tissue. The germinated pollen grains or male gametes travel down the pollen tube and fertilize the ovule. The ovules closest to the base of the ear develop silks first and silking proceeds up the ear to the tip.
 
R1 to Blister (R2) – this is the second reproductive stage and the kernels appear as whitish blisters on the cob. They contain much clear fluid and some starch.
 
R2 to Milk (R3) – by this stage the kernels contain a milky white fluid and the kernels are mostly yellow. Starch continues to accumulate.
 
R3 to Dough (R4) – the kernel’s fluid is a soft dough due to starch accumulation which continues in this stage. The kernels now have about 50% of their mature dry weight.
 
R4 to Dent (R5) – the kernels show a dent in the crown. There is also a milk line which is the boundary between the milk and starch layers. The milk line is near the dent end of the kernel  and progresses to the tip end of the kernel over approximately three weeks.
 
R5 to Maturity R6) – at this stage the kernels are at their maximum dry weight and are considered to be physiologically mature. This occurs just after the milk line disappears and just before the black layer forms at the tip of the kernel.
 
R6 to Harvest Ready – the kernels are ready for harvest when their moisture content has decreased to near 25%. Minimal damage will occur during harvest.

The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.
 
The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Corn hybrids which are divided based on Days in which they are expected to reach maturity given normal growing conditions. The hybrids here range from 90-Day to 120 Day. The Generic hybrid is considered to be the same as the 110-Day hybrid.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
