Save Current Scenario
The ‘Save Current Scenario’ screen is accessed from the ‘Save Scenario…’ button on the ‘Output From PhenologyMMS’ screen. This will save the inputs used to create the current scenario. This can then be used to re-run the current scenario.
 
Be sure to save the file to the ‘saves’ folder as it is in this folder that PhenologyMMS 1.3 looks for the scenarios to populate the list of saved scenarios in the ‘Begin Setup’ screen drop down for the Load Saved Scenarios button.
 
From the ‘Look In:’ drop down text box, you can browse to the appropriate location. Once the location is found, choose the ‘saves’ folder, in which to save the scenario.
 
The icons on the right side of the ‘Look In:’ drop down provide other options:
 
•         From the left-most icon: you can navigate up one folder , save the output file to the desktop  or create a new folder  in which to save the output.
•         The two right-most icons allow you to show the display of folders as a list  or with details  such as the ‘last modified date’.
 
When the location is selected in which to save the file, give the scenario file a name. There is only one file type available which is text with a .dat extension. Press the ‘Save’ button to complete the save operation or press ‘Cancel’ to stop the operation. Either of these buttons will close the screen when pressed.
