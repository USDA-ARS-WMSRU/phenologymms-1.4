Output
The ‘Output From PhenologyMMS’ screen contains the information for the model run, as well as the output from the run.
 
The top portion of the screen, as seen in the next two images, contains all inputs provided to the model including the parameters from the Growth Stages screen.
 
 

 

 
 
The middle portion of the Output screen shows the Note concerning the display of 999 in the output which may be due to the planting date being selected outside the range of the weather years in the selected weather file (meaning weather data were not available). A portion of the Leaf Number table is then displayed which shows the increase in number of leaves and the corresponding day of year (DOY) when this amount occurred. The number of leaves is incremented only when the next integer is reached, therefore there is a gap in time between DOY of one leaf and DOY of the next leaf. The number of leaves continues to increment until the end of leaf growth. The growth stage at which this occurs varies between crops.
 

 
At the bottom of the Output screen, the Phenology table is displayed. This table shows for each Phenological Event (i.e., Growth stage) the day of year (DOY), date, days after planting (DAP), days after emergence (DAE), days after vernalization (DAV), GDD from planting (GDD AP), GDD from emergence (GDD AE), GDD from vernalization (GDD AV), and number of leaves that had appeared (LN) when that event occurred. Not all columns apply to all crops. For example, those crops not requiring vernalization will not have a DAV or GDD AV column. The number of leaves is displayed for each growth stage up to and including the stage where leaf growth ends. For every stage thereafter, the number remains the same as the maximum number achieved at the end of the leaf growth stage.
 
The Maximum Canopy Height for the crop is displayed at the bottom of the table.
 
There are several buttons at the bottom of the screen:
 
The ‘Back…’ button - takes you back to the first screen, ‘Begin Setup’. You can then set up a new run and run a different scenario or Load a Saved Scenario.
 
The ‘Save Output …’ button - opens the ‘Save Output From Current Run’ dialog box where you can save the output from the current run. It is usually saved in the 'results' folder and the saved file contains only the Leaf Number table and the Phenology table.
 
The ‘Save Scenario…’ button opens the ‘Save Current Scenario’ dialog box to the ‘saves’ folder. This saves all the input data used to run the current crop and produce the current output. This saved file will then be in the list of scenarios that you can choose from in the ‘Begin Setup’ screen.  NOTE: to see this new scenario in the listing, exit the program and restart it to update the list so that it includes the new scenario.
 

 
Press the ‘Exit’ button to close the program.
