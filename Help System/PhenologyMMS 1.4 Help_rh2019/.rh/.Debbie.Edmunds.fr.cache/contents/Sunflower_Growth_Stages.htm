Sunflower Growth Stages
The Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
PhenologyMMS presents fourteen growth stages for sunflower. The following publication was very helpful in the description of each stage: Schneiter, A. A. and J. F. Miller (1981).

Seeding to Emergence (E) - at emergence, the hypocotyl arch and the cotyledons have pushed through the soil. The first true leaf blade is present but not yet long enough to be counted as a leaf. A leaf blade is considered to be a true leaf when it has attained a length of 4 cm.
 
E to 4th Leaf (V4) - four leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.
 
V4 to 8th Leaf (V8) - eight leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.
 
V8 to 12th Leaf (V12) - twelve leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.
 
V12 to Flower Visible (R1) - the inflorescence becomes visible. It is surrounded by immature bracts which when viewed from above have a star-like appearance. The appearance of R1 can vary among genotypes with respect to the number of leaves already produced.
 
R1 to Internode Elongation Starts  (R2) - the internode below the base of the inflorescence and above the nearest leaf that is attached to the stem, begins to elongate but is less than 2 cm.
 
R2 to Internode Elongation > 2 cm (R3) - the internode below the base of the developing head continues to elongate and is now greater than 2 cm. It pushes the inflorescence above the surrounding leaves.
 
R3 to Flower Opens (R4) - the inflorescence begins to open making small ray flowers visible.
 
R4 to Anthesis Starts (R5) - the ray flowers are mature and fully extended. All the disk flowers are visible. This stage can be divided into substages depending on how many of the disk flowers are in or have completed anthesis.
 
R5 to Anthesis Ends (R6) - at this stage, anthesis is finished and the ray flowers are wilting. The ray flowers vary as to whether they wilt and abscise immediately or not.
 
R6 to Flower Yellow (R7) - the back of the head begins to turn a light yellow beginning at the center of the head or it may start at the edge of the head adjacent to the bracts.
 
R7 to Flower Brown (R8) - the back of the head is yellow but may contain some brown spots. The bracts are still green.
 
R8 to Maturity (R9) - the bracts are turning yellow and brown. Much of the back of the head may become brown. This is physiological maturity and seed moisture is about 35%.
 
R9 to Harvest Ready - the plant is ready for harvest when the seeds are at 14 - 15 % moisture. They need to be dried down to 10% after harvest.

The Help... button opens a screen displaying help for this screen.
 
The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Sunflower varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity and type. There are four varieties relating to maturity and include Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Generic which are equivalent, and Late Maturity. Two additional varieties are listed for Oil and Seed sunflowers.
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
