Growth Stages Example
The Growth Stages screen in PhenologyMMS is designed specifically for each crop. It contains the appropriate growth stages for the crop and provides two ways to determine which growth stage the plant is in. The image below displays the Generic variety of Winter Wheat.
 
 
 

 
 
The left hand side of the screen contains parameters for each stage using Growing Degree Days (GDD), i.e., thermal time, in a non-stressed environment comparable to an irrigated field and a stressed environment analogous to a dryland or rainfed operation.
 
The two columns on the right hand side of the screen show the number of leaves added at each growth stage based on the phyllochron entered for the crop on the Temperatures screen in the "Growing Degree-Days per Leaf" edit box, again under non-stressed and stressed conditions. These values are editable.  
 
If the user has a better estimate of the number of GDD for a stage or stages or for the number of leaves in any of the four columns, they may enter that value for the appropriate stage.  Rarely, is a crop completely stressed or completely non-stressed so an intermediate value may be a better choice in either the stressed or the non-stressed column - whichever one the user feels the crop is closest to under current conditions. A combination of selections can be used. For example, a user might select some number of growth stage values in the non-stressed column while the plant/crop is not stressed and then select growth stage values in the stressed column when the plant/crop is likely to encounter stressful growing conditions. The same applies to the Number of Leaves columns if the user is using this method to determine when a growth stage is reached. It is possible to use any combination of all four columns. Note: if the GDD value for a stage is changed, the number of leaves for that stage does not update.
 
The other selection the user will want to make is the Variety. Different crops have differing numbers of varieties available in the Variety drop-down box. At the least, there are always four varieties: Generic, Early Maturity, Medium Maturity and Late Maturity. The Medium Maturity variety is equal to the Generic variety. Corn is the exception to this standard. Corn is presented in terms of 'Days', e.g., '110 Day', which indicates the approximate days to maturity. For some crops, additional named varieties or plant type varieties are given. Spring Barley and Spring Wheat add additional varieties based on the total number of leaves expected, e.g., '8-leaved;. Sunflower adds two varieties for the Oil and Seed (confectionery) types of sunflower.
