Spring Wheat Growth Stages
The Spring Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
 
There are eleven growth stages for Spring Wheat and they are identical to those for Winter Wheat but without the overwintering period and the 'Jan 1 to Single Ridge' stage. A description of the growth stages follows:
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first true leaf pushes and then emerges from the tip resulting in emergence.
 
E to First Tiller - the first tiller emerges.
 
E  to Single Ridge (SR) - Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.
 
SR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.
 
DR to Terminal Spikelet (TS) - spikelet primordia continue to be initiated with the terminal spikelet primordium formed just before Jointing.
 
TS to Jointing (J) - the head is fully formed and can be seen inside the stem if the stem is cut open. The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.
 
J to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.
 
FLC to Heading (H) -  the head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath resulting in heading.
 
H to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets. Flowering then progresses up and down the wheat spike.
 
AS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the "watery ripe" and "milk" stages. Then the "soft dough" phase occurs followed by the "hard dough" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels continue to lose moisture throughout grain filling until they reach 30-40% at physiological maturity. The head and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is at maturity.
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.

The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Spring Wheat varieties in a general sense based on number of leaves. There are five varieties and include 7-Leaved, 8-Leaved which is equivalent to Generic, 9-Leaved, 10-Leaved, and >10-Leaved. There are also three varieties designated by relative time to maturity and include Early Maturity which is equivalent to the 7-Leaved variety, Medium Maturity which is equivalent to Generic, 8-Leaved and 9-Leaved varieties and Late Maturity which is equivalent to the 10-Leaved and >10-Leaved varieties..
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
