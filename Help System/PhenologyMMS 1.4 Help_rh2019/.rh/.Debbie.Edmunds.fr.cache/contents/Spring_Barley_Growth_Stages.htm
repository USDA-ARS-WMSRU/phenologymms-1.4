Spring Barley Growth Stages
The Spring Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
 
There are eleven growth stages for Spring Barley and they are similar to those for Spring Wheat. However, the 'Double Ridge to Terminal Spikelet' stage of Spring Wheat, is replaced with the 'Double Ridge to Awn Initials Formed' stage in Spring Barley. A description of the growth stages follows:
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first main shoot leaf emerges from the coleoptile.
 
E to First Tiller - the first tiller occurs when there are about three leaves.
 
E  to Single Ridge (SR) - the time from emergence to Single Ridge. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.
 
SR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develops into spikelet primordia resulting in the double ridge stage.
 
DR to Awn Initials Formed (AIF) - the awn initials are formed in this stage.
 
AIF to Jointing (J) -The stem begins to elongate and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.  The head is growing rapidly but is still quite small.
 
J to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.
 
FLC to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. This occurs just before or during head emergence from the flag leaf. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets and progresses to the tip and the base of the barley head.
 
AS to Heading (H) -  the first awns are seen emerging from the collar of the flag leaf indicating heading has begun. The head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath.
 
H to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the "watery ripe" and "milk" stages. Then the "soft dough" phase occurs followed by the "hard dough" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose their green color at the hard dough stage. The kernels continue to lose moisture throughout grain filling until they reach 30-40% at physiological maturity. The glumes and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is mature..
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.

The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Spring Barley varieties in a general sense based on number of leaves. There are five varieties and include 7-Leaved, 8-Leaved which is equivalent to Generic, 9-Leaved, 10-Leaved, and >10-Leaved. There are also three varieties designated by relative time to maturity and include Early Maturity which is equivalent to the 7-Leaved variety, Medium Maturity which is equivalent to Generic, 8-Leaved and 9-Leaved varieties and Late Maturity which is equivalent to the 10-Leaved and >10-Leaved varieties..
 
The Run... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
