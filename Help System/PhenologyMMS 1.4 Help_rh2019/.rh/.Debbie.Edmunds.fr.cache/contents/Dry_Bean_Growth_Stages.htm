Dry Bean Growth Stages
The Growth Stages screen for Dry Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is displayed below showing the parameters for the Generic variety. 
 Please see the Growth 
 Stages Example topic for a general description 
 of the growth stages screen.
 

 
There are fourteen 
 growth stages for dry beans. According to the "Dry 
 Bean Production & Pest Management Bulletin 562A", there are 
 four developmental stages in Dry Beans. Stage I is the first part of the vegetative phase and includes germination, emergence and the early 
 part of vegetative growth. Stage II occurs in the latter half of the vegetative 
 phase from the emergence of the third trifoliate 
 leaf to the first flower opening. Stage III is in 
 the first part of the reproductive 
 phase of the life cycle. While in Stage III, the plant 
 progresses from the first flower to mid pod set. 
 The last stage, Stage IV, completes the reproductive phase of plant growth 
 and occurs from the beginning of filling of the first-formed pods to maturity and 
 ready for harvest.
 
Vegetative:
Seeding to 
 Emergence E) - the seedling emerges 
 through the soil and the hypocotyl appears.
E to Cotyledonary Leaves (VC) - there are two cotyledons 
 above ground at the first node and 
 two primary, unifoliate leaves are 
 unfolded at node 2.
VC to 1st Trifoliate 
 Leaf (V1) - the first trifoliate leaf has unfolded at node 3.
V1 to 2nd Trifoliate 
 Leaf (V2) - the second trifoliate leaf has unfolded at node 4.
V2 to 3rd Trifoliate 
 Leaf (V3) - the third trifoliate leaf has unfolded at node 5.
V3 to 4th Trifoliate 
 Leaf (V4) - the fourth trifoliate leaf has unfolded at node 6. Branches 
 develop and vegetative growth progresses rapidly.
 
Reproductive:
V4 to Bloom (R1) - there is one 
 open flower.
R1 to Mid-Full Flower (R2) - 50% 
 of the flowers are open.
R2 to Early Pod Set (R3/VN) - one pod has reached maximum 
 length. The Early Pod Set R3 
 stage is also the VN stage when the last trifoliate leaf is produced. 
 Leaves continue to be added until  the R3/VN stage.
R3 to Mid Pod Set (R4) - 50% of 
 the pods are at maximum length.
R4 to Early Seed Fill (R5) - one 
 pod has fully developed seeds.
R5 to Mid Seed Fill (R6) - 50% 
 of the pods contain fully developed seeds.
R6 to Maturity (R7) 
 - one pod has changed color to a mature color such as yellow, tan, purple 
 or even striped. This indicates physiological 
 maturity.
R7 to Harvest Ready (R8) - the 
 plant is ready to be harvested; 80% of the pods have changed to the mature 
 color.

 Back... button will take you back to the previous screen .
 
The Help... button 
 opens a screen displaying help for this screen.
 
The 
 Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Dry Bean types 
 and varieties. There are three selections based on time to 
 Maturity and include Early Maturity (E, 
 85-95 days), Medium Maturity (also 
 Generic in this listing) (M, 90-94 days), Full Season (F, 
 95-99 days) (not currently included in the variety drop down list) and Late Maturity (L, 100 or 
 more days). Quite a few varieties are listed with these Maturity designations.
 
The Run... button executes the program 
 with the selections that have been chosen.
 
The Reset button 
 sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.
