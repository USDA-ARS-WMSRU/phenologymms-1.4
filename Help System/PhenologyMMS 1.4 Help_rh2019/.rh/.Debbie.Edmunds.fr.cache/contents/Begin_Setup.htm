Begin Setup
The Begin Setup Screen appears when the Welcome screen closes. It is in this screen that very basic choices are selected. This includes the Crop and the Location Weather files. You can run the model with just these two selections if you are happy with the default values for the other selections found in the Set Inputs screen, Temperatures screen and the crop's Growth Stages screen.
 

 
Choose Crop – select the crop you wish to simulate by clicking the down arrow on the Crop drop-down box. The list includes all the crops for which PhenologyMMS 1.4 has been parameterized.
 
Select Location Weather File – click on the down arrow on the drop down box and choose a weather file from those listed. Generally, the naming convention is the state_city (2 letter code for the state)_beginning year and ending year of data. For example, 'CO_Akron_1813' indicates that there are data from 1918 to 2013 for Akron, Colorado.
 
NOTE: If you add a weather file to the MMSWeather folder while you are running PhenologyMMS 1.4, the weather file will not be visible in the drop down list. You must close the program and restart it for the newly added file to be visible. Be sure the new file has the .dat extension.

Saved Scenarios
The ‘Load Saved Scenario’ button - If you would like to re-run a previously saved scenario, click on the drop down arrow on the box near the ‘Load Saved Scenario’ button. That will display a list of all saved scenarios. Click on the scenario to be re-run and then press the ‘Load Saved Scenario’ button. If you have selected a scenario that runs a different crop than that selected or uses a different weather file, these changes will appear in the Choose Crop drop down and/or in the Location/Weather Files drop down boxes.
 
To Save a Scenario, you will do this from the Output screen via the ‘Save Scenario…’ button. If you save a scenario after a run and come back to the Begin Setup screen, the newly saved scenario will not be visible in the drop down box.  You will need to close the program and re-start it for the file to appear. CAUTION: Make sure to add the extension ‘.dat’ to the file name when saving it or it will not be visible in the saved scenarios list the next time you open the program.
 
The ‘Help’ button - accesses the Help System.
 
The ‘Disclaimer…’ button - displays the USDA-ARS disclaimer statement: “USDA-ARS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION NOR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS OF THE INFORMATION IN OR PRODUCED BY THE PHENOLOGYMMS SOFTWARE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.”
 
Three buttons below the picture are used to navigate to other screens. These include: ‘Set Inputs…’, ‘Set Growth Stages…’ and ‘Run…’.
 
The ‘Set Inputs …’ button - opens the ‘Set Inputs’ screen where planting information is entered. Default values load with the program so you can simply accept these values or customize them for your location.
 
The ‘Set Growth Stages…’ button - opens the ‘Set Growth Stages’ screen for the selected crop and displays the growing degree-days (GDD) parameters for each growth stage for Non-Stressed conditions (GN) and for Stressed conditions (GS). Parameters for Number of Leaves for each growth stage are also given for Non-Stressed (LN) conditions and for Stressed (LS) conditions.
 
The ‘Run…’ button - causes the program to run displaying output in the Output Screen.
