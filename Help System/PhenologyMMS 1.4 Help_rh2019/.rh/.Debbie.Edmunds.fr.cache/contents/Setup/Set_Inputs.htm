Set Inputs
The Set Inputs Screen contains basic planting information. The information in this screen can be changed if the default values do not apply to your location/setup, or if you want to explore what might happen with different input values.
 

 
Planting Date - Most likely you will want to change the date. Enter it in the format of mm/dd/yyyy.
 
Soil moisture -This always defaults to Optimum, but there are three other choices. These include Medium, Dry and Planted In Dust. These are simply general descriptive terms to describe the soil moisture at the time of planting which is used in predicting emergence of the crop. Within the model, these terms are converted to a numerical representation for the soil.  While these values have specific ranges of soil moisture (not shown), for most purposes each category is intended to represent general planting conditions.  A simple algorithm within the program will use rainfall events to increment the category chosen to a more favorable soil moisture condition, but the category does not decrease due to evaporation. For more information regarding emergence in the model, please refer to Emergence in PhenologyMMS.
 
Planting Depth - This is entered in centimeters (cm) and affects only the time of seedling emergence.
 
Planting Rate (pounds/square meter) - This is also available for editing, although currently this input does not affect the timing of any phenological event.
 
Latitude - Enter the value for your location in degrees, e.g., 40.165. Values that are positive are located in the Northern Hemisphere while negative values are located in the Southern Hemisphere. In the future, this will be used in determining the photoperiod effect for a crop but, it is not currently implemented.
 
Maximum Canopy Height - This is entered in centimeters (cm) and is the maximum potential canopy height under optimal conditions, for the crop being simulated. Please note: the final plant height predicted by the model is not influenced by any stresses (e.g., water stress).
 
Several buttons are available below the picture for screen navigation:
 
The ‘Close and Save’ button - closes this window and returns to the previous screen (i.e., ’Begin Setup’ screen). It also saves the information on this screen.
 
The ‘Reset’ button - resets the values back to the original default values.
 
The ‘Temperatures’ - button opens the ‘Temperatures’ screen where temperature and other values are presented. However, it is strongly recommended that the information in this screen is not changed as changing these values will negatively influence the program.  They are presented here for information purposes only.
 
The ‘Run…’ button - runs the program and displays output in the Output screen.
 
The ‘Help…’ button - accesses the Help System.
