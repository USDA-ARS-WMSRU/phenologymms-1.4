Winter Barley Growth Stages
The Winter Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Growth Stages screen displayed below shows the parameters for the Generic variety. Please see the Growth Stages Example topic for a general description of the growth stages screen.
 

 
There are eleven growth stages for Winter Barley and they are similar to those for Winter Wheat. However, the 'Double Ridge to Terminal Spikelet' stage of Winter Wheat, is replaced with the 'Double Ridge to Awn Initials Formed' stage for Winter Barley. A description of the growth stages follows:
 
Seeding to Emergence (E) - germination occurs and the coleoptile pushes through to the soil surface. The first main shoot leaf emerges from the coleoptile.
 
E to First Tiller - the time from emergence to the first tiller.
 
Jan 1 to Single Ridge (SR) - Jan. 1 is an accepted date in the Northern hemisphere from which to begin accumulation of growing degree-days for the growth of the crop. Single Ridge occurs when the shoot apex first elongates. Subsequent leaf primordia cease further development and they form a single ridge around the apex.
 
SR to Double Ridge (DR) - the tissue between the single ridges develop into spikelet primordia which is the double ridge stage.
 
DR to Awn Initials Formed (AIF) - the awn initials are formed in this stage.
 
AIF to Jointing (J) -The stem then begins elongating and jointing occurs when the first node is visible just above the soil line or at the base of the shoot.  The head is growing rapidly but is still quite small.
 
J to Flag Leaf Complete (FLC) - the flag leaf is the last leaf to emerge from the whorl and is completely emerged when the leaf's ligule is visible. It encloses the prominent head and this is referred to as booting or Flag Leaf Complete.
 
FLC to Heading (H) -  when the first awns are seen emerging from the collar of the flag leaf, heading has begun. The head is pushed out of the flag leaf sheath.
 
H to Anthesis Starts (AS) - the head is beginning to flower or pollinate. Anthers are visible at this stage and extruded from the florets. Pollination occurs beginning with the florets in the central spikelets and progresses to the tip and the base of the barley head.
 
AS to Maturity (M) - once pollination has occurred, the kernels progress through three phases of growth during grain filling. The first is the "watery ripe" and "milk" stages. Then the "soft dough" phase occurs followed by the "hard dough" phase as the kernel approaches maturity. The kernels lose their green color at the hard dough stage. The kernels lose moisture throughout grain filling and are between 30-40% at physiological maturity. The glumes and peduncle lose their green color by the time the plant is mature.
 
M to Harvest Ready - the kernels continue to lose  moisture and should be harvested when they are at 13 - 14% moisture.
