Save Current Output
This screen is accessed from the ‘Save Output’ button on the ‘Output From PhenologyMMS’ screen. This selection saves only the Output from the Current Run. Setup parameters and values are not included.
 
Select the Project folder you are running from to save the output with the project. From the ‘Look In:’ drop down text box, you can browse to the appropriate location. Once the location is found, choose the folder, e.g., the Results folder, in which to save the output.
 
The icons on the right side of the ‘Look In:’ drop down provide other options:
•         From the left-most icon: you can navigate up one folder , save the output file to the desktop  or create a new folder  in which to save the output.
•         The two right-most icons allow you to show the display of folders as a list  or with details  such as the ‘last modified date’.
 
 
When the location is selected, give the file a name. There is only one file type available which is text with a .dat extension.
 
Press the ‘Save’ button to complete saving the output or press the ‘Cancel’ button to abort the operation. This screen will close when either button is pressed.
