<p>PhenologyMMS presents fourteen growth stages for sunflower. The following publication was very helpful in the description of each stage: <a href="References_and_Documents.htm#Sunflower_growth_stages"><span class="spelle">Schneiter</span>, A. A. and J. F. Miller (1981)</a>. Description of sunflower growth stages. <u>Crop Sci.</u> <b>21</b>(6): 901-903 URL: <a href="https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/pdfs/21/6/CS0210060901">https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/pdfs/21/6/CS0210060901</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a data-glossterm="Seeding" class="glossterm">Seeding</a> to <a data-glossterm="Emergence" class="glossterm">Emergence</a> (E) - at emergence, the <a data-glossterm="hypocotyl" class="glossterm">hypocotyl</a> arch and the cotyledons have pushed through the soil. The first true leaf blade is present but not yet long enough to be counted as a leaf. A leaf blade is considered to be a true leaf when it has attained a length of 4 cm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>E to 4th Leaf (V4) - four <a data-glossterm="leaves" class="glossterm">leaves</a> are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V4 to 8th Leaf (V8) - eight leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V8 to 12th Leaf (V12) - twelve leaves are present that are 4 cm or greater in length.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>V12 to <a data-glossterm="Flower Visible" class="glossterm">Flower Visible</a> (R1) - the <a data-glossterm="inflorescence" class="glossterm">inflorescence</a> becomes visible. It is surrounded by immature bracts which when viewed from above have a star-like appearance. The appearance of R1 can vary among genotypes with respect to the <a data-glossterm="number of leaves" class="glossterm">number of leaves</a> already produced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R1 to Internode Elongation Starts  (R2) - the internode below the base of the inflorescence and above the nearest leaf that is attached to the <a data-glossterm="stem" class="glossterm">stem</a>, begins to elongate but is less than 2 cm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R2 to Internode Elongation &gt; 2 cm (R3) - the internode below the base of the developing <a data-glossterm="head" class="glossterm">head</a> continues to elongate and is now greater than 2 cm. It pushes the inflorescence above the surrounding leaves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R3 to <a data-glossterm="Flower Opens" class="glossterm">Flower Opens</a> (R4) - the inflorescence begins to open making small ray flowers visible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R4 to <a data-glossterm="Anthesis Starts" class="glossterm">Anthesis Starts</a> (R5) - the ray flowers are mature and fully extended. All the <a data-glossterm="disk flowers" class="glossterm">disk flowers</a> are visible. This stage can be divided into substages depending on how many of the disk flowers are in or have completed <a data-glossterm="anthesis" class="glossterm">anthesis</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R5 to <a data-glossterm="Anthesis Ends" class="glossterm">Anthesis Ends</a> (R6) - at this stage, anthesis is finished and the ray flowers are wilting. The ray flowers vary as to whether they wilt and abscise immediately or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R6 to <a data-glossterm="Flower Yellow" class="glossterm">Flower Yellow</a> (R7) - the back of the head begins to turn a light yellow beginning at the center of the head or it may start at the edge of the head adjacent to the bracts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R7 to <a data-glossterm="Flower Brown" class="glossterm">Flower Brown</a> (R8) - the back of the head is yellow but may contain some brown spots. The bracts are still green.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R8 to <a data-glossterm="Maturity" class="glossterm">Maturity</a> (R9) - the bracts are turning yellow and brown. Much of the back of the head may become brown. This is <a data-glossterm="physiological maturity" class="glossterm">physiological maturity</a> and <a data-glossterm="seed" class="glossterm">seed</a> moisture is about 35%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R9 to <a data-glossterm="Harvest Ready" class="glossterm">Harvest Ready</a> - the plant is ready for harvest when the seeds are at 14 - 15 % moisture. They need to be dried down to 10% after harvest.</p>

<p>The Variety drop down list displays the available selections of Sunflower varieties in a general sense based on time to maturity and type. There are four varieties relating to maturity and include <a data-glossterm="Early Maturity" class="glossterm">Early Maturity</a>, <a data-glossterm="Medium Maturity" class="glossterm">Medium Maturity</a> and <a data-glossterm="Generic" class="glossterm">Generic</a> which are equivalent, and <a data-glossterm="Late Maturity" class="glossterm">Late Maturity</a>. Two additional varieties are listed for <a data-glossterm="Oil" class="glossterm">Oil</a> and <a data-glossterm="Seed sunflowers" class="glossterm">Seed sunflowers</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a data-glossterm="Run" class="glossterm">Run</a>... button executes the program with the selections that have been chosen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Reset button sets all the values in the columns back to their original, default values.</p>
